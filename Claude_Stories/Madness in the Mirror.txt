Madness in the Mirror

Wind howled through the crumbling towers of Wardenmoor Asylum, perched like a broken crown on the cliffs above a dead sea. Inside, walls whispered with peeling paint, and the scent of mildew clung to everything. The inmates were ghosts of their former selves—shuffling, murmuring, forgotten. But among them was a man who was neither broken nor mad.

His name was Joren Malek.

Once a warlord feared across the continent of Sereth, Joren had ruled through fire and strategy, revered by his followers and loathed by the elite. When the final uprising failed—betrayed from within and crushed by the Crown Guard—Joren had disappeared, presumed dead. Only a few knew the truth: he’d surrendered under one condition—commitment to an asylum under a false name, his identity sealed forever.

It was supposed to be exile. Silence. Escape.

Until the murders began.

The first was a patient.

Eyes gouged, tongue removed, and the word "AWAKEN" carved into his chest. Within days, another body appeared—this time a nurse, found in the mirror chamber with her reflection shattered, her wrists bound behind her back with strands of her own hair.

Wardenmoor had always been strange, but this was ritual.

This was warning.

Joren recognized the signs.

They mirrored the blood rites of the Cult of the Shattered Eye—a fanatical sect that had once tried to align with his army. He had turned them away, horrified by their madness.

Now they had found him again.

A key figure entered the scene.

Forewoman Renna Vale.

Cool-headed, sharply dressed, unshaken by the grim surroundings. She had once served in the Royal Investigations Office before vanishing from public view. Her file was sealed. Her presence here? Unexplained.

She noticed Joren quickly.

Too quickly.

“I’ve read about you,” she said one evening, casually leaning against the common room’s cracked window. “Or I should say, I’ve read about the man you used to be.”

He raised an eyebrow but said nothing.

“You think you’re hiding here, but the cult isn’t looking for you,” she continued. “They’re looking for what you buried.”

Joren’s past came back like a storm.

Fifteen years earlier, during his final campaign, he had confiscated a strange relic from a desert sect—a mirror of obsidian glass, rumored to show not reflections but possibilities. When his commanders started turning on each other and whispering secrets no one should know, he sealed the artifact beneath a ruined monastery and burned the place to the ground.

The cult believed the mirror spoke to chosen minds.

And now someone had brought it to Wardenmoor.

Together, Joren and Renna unearthed secrets buried deep in the asylum’s restricted floors.

Patients weren’t being treated. They were being tested—subjected to sleep deprivation, forced mirror exposure, and chemical injections.

They found notebooks from Dr. Andel Crane, the asylum’s former head, missing for years but still issuing orders through typed directives.

And worst of all: the relic had indeed arrived. Smuggled in under the guise of a donated artifact, now hidden in the sealed art therapy wing.

Its presence was warping the minds of the vulnerable.

Joren saw it in their eyes—patients speaking in riddles, repeating phrases they’d never learned, scratching images of shattered faces into the walls.

He even felt it in himself.

The mirror called to him.

The night of the eclipse, the cult revealed itself.

Disguised as orderlies and doctors, they took over the asylum from within.

They began preparing a ritual in the basement, planning to “awaken the future king,” convinced Joren was the vessel for an ancient prophecy.

Renna was captured.

Joren had to make a choice: run or face the madness he had fled from.

He chose war.

With nothing but an improvised blade and a stolen keycard, Joren descended into the underlevels of Wardenmoor.

He found Renna strapped to a gurney, surrounded by chanting cultists. In the center of the room stood the mirror—black, massive, humming with energy.

Joren stepped forward.

The mirror pulsed.

He saw visions—himself seated on a throne of bones, cities burning in his name, his enemies kneeling.

But he also saw himself walking away, into quiet obscurity, free of power and legacy.

He shattered the mirror with a scream.

The blast sent half the cult flying. Renna broke free, taking down the leader. The fire consumed the chamber as they escaped.

The government covered the story, as they always did.

They labeled it a "containment incident."

Wardenmoor was shuttered for good.

The mirror was never recovered—its shards scattered or locked away.

Renna resigned.

Joren vanished.

But somewhere, in a coastal village far from the scars of war, a fisherman named Joren keeps mostly to himself.

He does not look into mirrors.

He does not speak of the past.

And when strangers pass through the village, he offers them kindness and silence.

Because he has seen what happens when the wrong man listens to his reflection.
