Beneath the Asylum Sky

They brought him in under a false name: Elias Brand.

No trial, no press, no record.

Just a man in a straightjacket, his face covered, his past classified.

In truth, he was General Coren Vale—once a national hero, later the alleged architect of a massacre in the borderlands. The government needed to bury him without making a martyr, so they stashed him away in Merrow Hollow, a private asylum hidden beneath the mountains, funded by the military, forgotten by all.

He would’ve rotted quietly, if not for the death.

A nurse was found crushed in the aviary dome, her bones broken in impossible ways, as if dropped from a great height. There were no witnesses. No cameras. And no one reported seeing a bird large enough to cause it.

But Coren heard something that night.

Not words. Not screams.

Wings.

Forewoman Talia Renn arrived the next morning.

Young, sharp, and not afraid to tread where silence lingered. She had once served on a military inquiry board before resigning over “ethical disagreements.” They reassigned her to Merrow Hollow quietly, expecting she’d either fall in line or disappear.

Instead, she started asking questions.

The patients murmured about the “sky room.”

Staff ignored her. One even warned her not to “pry too deep unless you want to wake the walls.”

Which is exactly when she noticed Elias Brand.

Too alert.

Too quiet.

Too trained.

Talia cornered him during daily recess.

“I know who you are,” she whispered.

He didn’t flinch.

“I also know what you were blamed for,” she continued. “And I think someone wants to do it again—here.”

They teamed up in secret.

Talia provided keys, logs, and access. Coren gave her insight into military patterns, behavior modeling, and who might benefit from restarting Merrow Hollow’s hidden program.

Because that was the truth: the asylum wasn’t just for care.

It was a testing site.

Project Ascendant.

Officially disbanded, the program had once tried to unlock heightened sensory awareness through forced trauma, psychotropic isolation, and exposure to sonic resonance. The results were madness—or, in rare cases, brilliance. The project was shelved after a violent incident killed 22 civilians in the borderlands.

The same incident Coren had taken the fall for.

They discovered that the program had never really stopped.

It had gone deeper.

Buried beneath the asylum was a wing with reinforced cells, no names on the doors—only numbers. Inside were test subjects, heavily sedated. Their brainwaves were monitored for signs of “awakening.”

And one of them had.

Subject 7.

The nurse who died had attempted to wean 7 off sedatives—out of compassion.

Now she was dead.

And 7… was evolving.

The asylum began to change.

Lights flickered. Dreams bled into waking hours.

Birds flew into the walls, guided by something unseen.

Coren began hearing voices in frequencies too low to register on the human scale.

Talia found her thoughts repeating, looping, mutating.

They weren’t alone in their heads.

Subject 7 had become a broadcaster—sending thoughts across minds, pulling memories from people nearby.

It wanted something.

And as Coren stared into its cell through a one-way mirror, he felt what it was:

Lonely. Powerful. Angry.

It had no name. No shape. Just eyes that knew him.

“You made me,” it whispered in his mind. “And you abandoned me.”

Talia wanted to shut the program down, go public.

Coren hesitated.

He feared what would happen if Subject 7 escaped—or worse, if it died and took the minds of others with it.

So he did what he always did.

He made a plan.

They initiated a controlled lockdown, blamed on a gas leak. Patients were evacuated. Staff rerouted.

Coren stayed behind with Subject 7.

“Talia,” he said before she left, “if I don’t come back, write the truth.”

“You’re not doing this for redemption,” she said.

“No,” he replied. “I’m doing this so it ends with me.”

Inside the cell, the world bent.

Coren confronted Subject 7 directly.

“You’re not a weapon,” he said. “You’re a wound they tried to turn into a sword.”

It watched him.

“I know what they did. I know because they did it to me too.”

The silence that followed was suffocating.

Then, a voice—not 7’s—boomed across the intercom.

The project head.

Still alive.

Still watching.

He triggered a failsafe to incinerate the wing.

Coren had seconds.

He did the only thing he could: he opened the cell—not to let 7 escape, but to share himself.

His mind. His pain. His memories.

When the fires cleared, there was no sign of Coren.

Subject 7’s cell was empty.

And the broadcasting stopped.

Months later, Talia testified before an international tribunal.

Merrow Hollow was dismantled.

The truth about Project Ascendant went public.

And somewhere, across the outer provinces, people began to report strange dreams of wings, mountains, and a man who gave up everything to contain something no one could understand.

A man who whispered: “You are not alone.”
