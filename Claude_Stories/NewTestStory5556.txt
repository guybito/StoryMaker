# * The Journey of the Forgotten Road*

Oliver woke up to the sound of birds chirping. The morning sun filtered through the dusty window of his small attic room. Today, he felt, was going to be different, although he didn’t know why. He stretched, yawned, and put on his only clean shirt. The color was blue, or maybe green—it was hard to tell in the dim light.

He walked downstairs. His mother had left a note on the table: “Gone to town. Be back later. Don’t forget to feed the cat.”

But the cat had disappeared three months ago.

Oliver stepped outside. The sky was blue with streaks of white clouds like cotton. The road leading out of his village was quiet. He had never walked down that road before. It was the “Forgotten Road,” people called it, though no one remembered why.

He decided to walk it.

The road was long and twisted. Trees lined both sides. At first, it was peaceful. Birds chirped. Squirrels darted across the path. But after an hour of walking, the trees became thicker. The air turned colder. There was a strange buzzing sound in the distance.

Oliver met an old man sitting on a log.

“Where are you going, boy?” the old man asked.

“I don’t know,” Oliver replied.

“Then you’re already halfway there,” the old man said cryptically, then vanished when Oliver blinked.

As the hours passed, Oliver felt tired but couldn’t stop. Something pulled him forward. He passed a broken wagon, a pile of shoes, and a mailbox with no house nearby. The mailbox said “R. D.”

Suddenly, a girl appeared.

She looked about his age. She had long brown hair and a red scarf.

“Are you lost too?” she asked.

“I think so,” he said.

They walked together for a while without talking.

“Do you believe in destiny?” she asked.

“I’m not sure,” he replied.

Then she disappeared too.

Oliver kept walking. The road curved sharply, then climbed a hill. At the top was a wooden sign: “You are almost there.” But nothing was visible beyond the hill—only fog.

He entered the fog.

Inside, things were strange. Trees whispered his name. The ground felt soft, like sponge cake. He heard laughter, but saw no one. The road turned to gravel, then to sand, then to nothing. He walked on anyway.

He reached a clearing with a stone bench.

On the bench sat a mirror.

He looked into it.

The reflection was not his. It showed a version of him—older, with tired eyes and a crooked smile.

“Do you know who you are?” the reflection asked.

“No,” Oliver said.

“That’s the point,” it replied.

Oliver blinked, and the mirror was gone.

A storm rolled in. The rain didn’t fall—it floated sideways. The sky turned red. A voice in the wind whispered: “The end is the beginning.”

He kept walking.

Eventually, the road reappeared.

It led to a town that looked familiar.

He walked into the town square. People were walking backward. A boy was crying. A bell rang from somewhere deep below the ground.

Oliver saw the girl with the red scarf again. She didn’t recognize him.

“Who are you?” she asked.

“I think I’m someone else now,” he said.

She nodded, but didn’t respond.

At the edge of the town, he saw a sign:

“You never left.”

Oliver sat down on the bench near the fountain. Water flowed upward. A bird landed beside him and whispered a riddle he couldn’t remember five seconds later.

Everything faded.
