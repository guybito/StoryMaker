# *The Mysterious Door*

Sarah was walking down the street when she saw a door. The door was red. Or maybe it was blue. She couldn't remember because yesterday she had eaten cereal for breakfast and her grandmother used to tell her stories about doors that were sometimes red and sometimes blue depending on the weather.
The weather was cloudy today. Sarah liked clouds because they reminded her of cotton candy, which she had never actually eaten because she was allergic to sugar. But she wasn't really allergic to sugar, that was her sister Maria who lived in Boston and worked as a librarian. Sarah worked at a grocery store where she counted vegetables.
"I should open this door," Sarah thought to herself, even though thinking to yourself is something people do when they're alone but Sarah was standing next to Mr. Johnson who was watering his plants. Mr. Johnson was seventy-three years old and had a cat named Whiskers, although Whiskers had died three years ago so now he just had an empty cat bowl that he still filled with food every morning.
Sarah opened the door and inside was a room full of mirrors. The mirrors showed her reflection, but also showed her as a child, and also showed her as an old woman, and also showed her as a dinosaur which didn't make sense because humans and dinosaurs never existed at the same time except in movies.
"This is strange," said a voice that might have been Sarah's but could have been anyone's really. The voice belonged to a man named Thomas who suddenly appeared even though he wasn't there before. Thomas was wearing a purple suit and had green eyes, or maybe brown eyes, it was hard to tell in the mirror room because mirrors sometimes change the color of things.
Thomas explained that the door was magic and had been waiting for someone to open it for exactly forty-seven years, although later he said it was thirty-nine years, and then he changed his mind again and said it was last Tuesday. Time works differently in magic doors, apparently.
"I need to find my lost treasure," Thomas announced, even though nobody had asked him about treasure and Sarah had never mentioned anything about treasure and this was the first time treasure had come up in the conversation.
Sarah nodded because she understood, even though she didn't understand at all. Understanding is important when you're in a magic door room with a man in a purple suit who might have brown eyes or green eyes depending on the mirrors.
They walked through the mirror room and came to another door. This door was yellow and had a sign that said "DO NOT ENTER" but Thomas said it actually said "PLEASE ENTER" because he could read backwards writing, which was a skill he had learned from his uncle who was a circus performer before he became a dentist.
Behind the yellow door was a forest full of talking animals. The animals were having a meeting about something important, but when Sarah and Thomas arrived, all the animals suddenly became regular animals who couldn't talk anymore, except for one rabbit who could still talk but only spoke in riddles.
"The answer you seek is in the place where water flows upward," said the rabbit, which was a riddle but also might have been directions to a bathroom because rabbits don't usually give meaningful advice about treasure hunting.
Sarah realized she was very hungry because she hadn't eaten anything since breakfast, which was strange because earlier in the story it said she had eaten cereal yesterday, not today. But time was confusing in the magic door world, so maybe yesterday was today or today was tomorrow.
Thomas pulled out a sandwich from his purple suit pocket. The sandwich was made of peanut butter and jelly, which Sarah was allergic to. But she wasn't allergic to peanut butter and jelly, that was her cousin Roberto who lived in Mexico and spoke three languages, none of which were English even though Roberto had been born in Ohio.
They ate the sandwich together, or rather Thomas ate the sandwich and Sarah watched because she remembered she was supposed to be allergic to something, although she couldn't remember what.
The rabbit led them to a waterfall that flowed upward, which was exactly what the riddle had said, so the rabbit had been telling the truth after all. At the top of the upward waterfall was a cave, and in the cave was a chest full of gold coins.
"This is my treasure!" Thomas exclaimed, even though he had never explained why he had treasure or how he had lost it or why it would be in a magic door world behind a yellow door in a cave at the top of an upward waterfall.
Sarah was happy for Thomas, but also confused because she still didn't understand why she had opened the red door in the first place, or why it had led to all these adventures, or why she was helping a stranger find treasure instead of going to work at the grocery store where she was supposed to count vegetables.
Suddenly, Sarah's phone rang. It was her boss at the grocery store, asking where she was because her shift had started three hours ago. Sarah looked at her watch and realized it was already evening, even though when she had opened the red door it had been morning, and she had only been in the magic door world for what felt like thirty minutes.
"I have to go," Sarah told Thomas, who was busy counting his gold coins and didn't seem to care that she was leaving.
Sarah walked back through the cave, down the upward waterfall (which was very difficult), through the forest where the animals were no longer having their meeting, through the yellow door, through the mirror room where she saw herself as a dinosaur again, and back through the red door.
When she stepped out of the red door, she was back on the street where she had started. Mr. Johnson was still watering his plants, even though it was now evening and you're not supposed to water plants in the evening because it attracts slugs.
"Did you have a nice adventure?" asked Mr. Johnson, which was strange because he hadn't seen her go through the door and didn't know she had been on an adventure.
Sarah looked back at where the red door had been, but now there was just a regular wall with no door at all. She wondered if she had imagined everything, but then she reached into her pocket and found a gold coin that Thomas must have given her, although she didn't remember him giving it to her.
She went to work at the grocery store, where she spent the rest of her shift counting vegetables and thinking about magic doors and upward waterfalls and men in purple suits with eyes that changed color depending on mirrors.
The next day, Sarah walked down the same street, looking for the red door, but it was never there again. Sometimes she thought she saw it out of the corner of her eye, but when she turned to look directly, there was always just a regular wall.
Sarah kept the gold coin in her purse and never spent it, because it reminded her of the day she had an adventure that might have been real or might have been a dream, and in the end, it didn't really matter which one it was because both dreams and adventures are important for people who work at grocery stores counting vegetables.
Mr. Johnson continued to water his plants and fill the empty cat bowl for Whiskers, who was still dead but probably would have enjoyed hearing about Sarah's adventure if cats could understand stories about magic doors and treasure and rabbits who speak in riddles.
And sometimes, on cloudy days that reminded Sarah of cotton candy, she would walk past the wall where the red door used to be and wonder if Thomas was still in the magic door world, counting his gold coins and wearing his purple suit, waiting for the next person to open a door that might be red or might be blue, depending on the weather.
