# *The Apple that Whispered Fire*
In the morning, the sun was not a sun, but more like a banana. Larry knew this because the television told him, although he didn’t have one. His dog, Sandwich, barked in Portuguese and told him it was Tuesday. But Tuesday was on vacation that week, so Larry packed a suitcase full of soap and went to the airport on his bicycle made of spaghetti.

At the airport, nobody was flying. Instead, everyone was crawling backwards and asking for lemons. “Where are the turtles?” one man shouted into a shoe. Larry ignored him. He had a mission: to deliver the package to Aunt Marbles, who had been dead for five years. This did not bother Larry, since time was only a suggestion.

On the way to gate 404, which could not be found, Larry tripped on a thought. The floor was made of regret. “Oops,” he said, though no one was listening. The security guard was a turnip. It asked for identification, but Larry gave it a poem instead:

“Rocks are soft when they believe,
Ducks will scream if you deceive,
Carry the moon in a paper hat,
And never trust a purple cat.”

The turnip exploded.

Without delay, Larry boarded a paper airplane and sat next to a cloud named Greg. Greg was going to Florida, but also nowhere, because location was a myth. “Do you like hummingbirds?” Greg asked without a mouth.

“I prefer kazoo sandwiches,” Larry replied confidently, though he had never eaten anything but colors.

Suddenly, the plane turned into a courtroom. The judge was Larry’s ex-wife, a pinecone named Deborah. “You’ve violated the laws of narrative structure!” she cried. “You must answer to the Great Pillow.”

Larry wept bees.

The Great Pillow entered, bouncing rhythmically to the sound of jellyfish jazz. “Larry, you stand accused of plot abandonment, inconsistent tone, and character misuse,” it said in a deep, fluffy voice.

“I plead penguin,” Larry declared.

The courtroom gasped, then turned into a forest. Trees whispered secrets about the stock market. One tree claimed to be Elon Musk. Larry wasn’t convinced, but gave it a dollar anyway.

In the clearing, he saw Sandwich, his dog, now a toaster. “Bark,” said the toaster. “Your destiny lies beyond the noodles.”

So Larry walked west, even though west had retired. He crossed deserts of milk, rivers of regret, and a mountain made entirely of screaming pencils. At the summit, he met the Oracle of Unfinished Thoughts.

“What must I do to find Aunt Marbles?” he asked.

The Oracle blinked out of existence.

A unicorn passed by, sneezing explosions. Larry rode it sideways. During the journey, he remembered his childhood in the underground library where words were forbidden and everyone communicated through interpretive dance. He smiled at the memory of Grammar Uncle, who was eaten by a misused semicolon.

Finally, Larry reached the City of Eternal Tuesdays. It was Wednesday. A guard made of soup said, “You can’t enter unless you answer the question: What is the square root of banana?”

“Purple,” Larry said confidently.

The gates melted.

Inside the city, time ran backwards. Children were old, and old men were unborn. Larry aged into a child. A child aged into a television set. The streets were paved with jellybeans and despair.

At the central tower, he found Aunt Marbles playing chess with a dolphin. “You’re late,” she said, though he was early. “The ceremony has already begun.”

“What ceremony?”

She handed him a spoon. “You must stir the clouds.”

Larry stirred. Thunder applauded. The rain turned into paperclips and began organizing themselves alphabetically.

Suddenly, the dolphin exploded.

Aunt Marbles turned into a harmonica. Larry played her and the tune summoned the ghosts of all forgotten plotlines.

“I am resolved,” Larry declared, although nothing had been resolved.

The sky opened. A giant typewriter descended, each key a mistake. It began rewriting reality. Larry became a comma. Sandwich the toaster married a flamingo. The forest sued the courtroom for emotional damages.

In the end, everyone danced. Or they might have. It was hard to tell, because the story collapsed under its own weight and became a crumpled napkin in the mind of a squirrel dreaming of fish.
