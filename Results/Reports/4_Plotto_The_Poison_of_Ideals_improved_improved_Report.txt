1. **Is the main character clearly identifiable?**
   - Score: 4.0
   - Weight: 0.15
   - Weighted Score: 0.18
   - Dominic Mercer is unmistakably the protagonist, introduced immediately with clear physical description ("tall with broad shoulders and a jawline that could cut glass") and psychological characteristics (self-proclaimed moral compass).

2. **Does the character have a clear backstory?**
   - Score: 3.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.09

   - Score: 4.0
   - Weight: 0.10

4. **Does the character have a clear inner weakness or vulnerability?**
   - Score: 4.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.12

   - Score: 4.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.12
   - Dominic experiences a profound transformation from self-righteous moralist to humble realist. This arc is explicitly acknowledged: "That Dominicâ€”the one who had judged others while failing to examine himselfâ€”was gone."

   - Score: 4.0
   - Weight: 0.10

   - Score: 4.0

   - Score: 4.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.12

## Overall Weighted Score: 3.6650

## Summary Report:
"The Poison of Ideals" presents a compelling character study of moral hypocrisy and redemption. The story's greatest strengths lie in its well-developed protagonist whose transformation feels earned through genuine self-reflection, and its exploration of universal themes regarding the gap between professed values and actual behavior. The supporting characters effectively challenge and illuminate the protagonist's journey, while the multilayered conflict maintains tension throughout. The prose is technically strong, though some passages could be more concise and visually concrete.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Development**: While Dominic's character arc is strong, consider deepening his backstory to explain the origins of his rigid moral framework. What childhood experiences or influences shaped his need to see himself as morally superior?

* **Scene Visualization**: Add more sensory details to key scenes, particularly the confrontations between characters. The emotional impact would be strengthened by more concrete physical descriptions of environments and character reactions.

* **Pacing**: The final third of the story moves somewhat quickly through Dominic's redemption arc. Consider expanding key moments of his transformation in prison to make his change feel more gradual and hard-won.

* **Supporting Character Depth**: While Jordan is well-developed, his relatively quick shift toward reconciliation could be more thoroughly explored to increase credibility. What internal struggle did he face before deciding to support Dominic's nonprofit?

* **Thematic Subtlety**: Some of the reflective passages state the moral lessons too directly. Consider allowing readers to draw their own conclusions through character actions and dialogue rather than explicit statements about hypocrisy and redemption.
