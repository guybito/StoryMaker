The story excels in establishing clear stakes and maintaining consistent conflict while exploring themes of professional ethics, justice, and personal sacrifice. The protagonist's journey is convincingly portrayed, with his moral choices driving both plot and character development.

* **Increase medical accuracy**: Some medical procedures, particularly the improvised blood transfusion, should be portrayed with greater technical accuracy to maintain credibility.
* **Tighten pacing in middle sections**: Some expository passages could be condensed to maintain tension throughout the narrative.
* **Clarify rescue logistics**: The timing and logistics of the helicopter rescue could be more thoroughly explained to strengthen plot credibility.
