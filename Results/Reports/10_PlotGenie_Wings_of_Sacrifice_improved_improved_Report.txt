## Overall Weighted Score: 3.3950

## Summary Report:
"Wings of Sacrifice" presents a compelling adventure thriller with strong central characters and a clear conflict. The story effectively builds tension through its bioweapon plot and the protagonist's moral dilemma. The Amazon setting provides an interesting backdrop, though it could be more vividly rendered. While the narrative maintains reader interest through its life-or-death stakes and romantic subplot, it suffers from some logical inconsistencies and convenient plot resolutions that undermine its otherwise solid structure.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Development**: Deepen Marco's backstory and personal history to make his moral choices more resonant. Currently, we know little about his life before meeting Gabriela, which limits our understanding of his character arc.

* **Logical Consistency**: Strengthen the plausibility of key plot points, particularly how Marco infiltrates Mendes's office, how Eleanor creates a diversion, and how quickly authorities respond. These moments currently feel too convenient.

* **Setting Description**: Enhance the sensory details of the Amazon setting to create a more immersive experience. The rainforest could become almost another character in the story rather than just a backdrop.

* **Supporting Character Depth**: Develop Eleanor and James beyond their functional roles by giving them more distinctive personalities and showing (rather than telling) their past relationship.

* **Pacing**: Tighten the final third of the story, which becomes somewhat repetitive in its explanations and reflections. The resolution could be more concise while maintaining its emotional impact.
