## Overall Weighted Score: 3.6050

## Report:
"Frequencies of the Soul" is an impressive supernatural thriller that skillfully blends historical elements with science fiction concepts. The story's greatest strengths lie in its character development, particularly Amara's journey of self-discovery, and its well-constructed central conflict with escalating stakes. The prose is polished and descriptive, creating a vivid 1940s setting enhanced by supernatural elements. While some explanatory passages could be more concise and certain plot elements remain deliberately mysterious, the story maintains strong internal logic and consistency throughout its complex worldbuilding.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Pacing and Structure:** Consider tightening the middle sections where explanations of Eternal history and the Project's background are delivered. These informational passages, while necessary, occasionally slow the narrative momentum.

* **Character Development:** While Amara's character is well-developed, Dr. Thorne remains somewhat opaque. His ambiguous nature is intriguing, but providing more subtle hints about his true agenda earlier would strengthen the revelation of his questionable motives.

* **Worldbuilding Integration:** The rules and history of the Eternals are fascinating but sometimes delivered in exposition-heavy blocks. Look for opportunities to reveal this information more organically through character interactions and experiences.

* **Subplot Balance:** The romantic subplot between Amara and Ethan could be more fully developed to provide emotional counterpoint to the supernatural elements. Their connection is established but could benefit from more intimate moments that reveal their growing feelings.

* **Sensory Experience:** While the visual and auditory elements are well-described, incorporating more of the other senses (smell, taste, touch) would further immerse readers in both the period setting and the supernatural experiences.
