## Summary Report
"Wings of Sacrifice" is a well-crafted thriller with strong character development and compelling conflict. The story excels in establishing clear stakes and maintaining tension throughout its narrative arc. Marco's moral dilemma provides emotional depth, while the Amazon setting creates an effective backdrop for the bioterrorism plot. The prose is technically sound, though some descriptive elements and secondary character development could be enhanced. Overall, the story successfully balances action sequences with emotional moments to create an engaging reading experience.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Development**: Expand James Cortez's characterization to make him more distinct and memorable, as he currently serves primarily as a plot device rather than a fully realized character.

* **Setting Description**: Enhance the sensory details of the Amazon setting to create a more immersive experience, particularly in the research station scenes where the environment could contribute more to the atmosphere of isolation and danger.

* **Scientific Plausibility**: Provide more specific details about the bioweapon and its antidote to increase credibility, particularly regarding how quickly the antidote works and how it was developed.

* **Subplot Integration**: Develop the relationship between Eleanor and James to add dimension to their characters and create a more layered narrative structure.

* **Villain Motivation**: Deepen Mendes's characterization beyond the profit motive to make him a more complex antagonist, perhaps by exploring his background or providing a more nuanced justification for his actions.
