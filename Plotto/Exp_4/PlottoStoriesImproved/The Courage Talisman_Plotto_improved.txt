# *The Courage Talisman*

Leo Winters hunched over her desk at the back of the bustling newsroom, trying to make herself as small as possible. The cacophony of ringing phones, clacking keyboards, and overlapping conversations washed over her like white noise. At twenty-seven, she had been with the Chicago Tribune for three years, yet remained firmly anchored to the lifestyle section, writing fluff pieces about local bakeries and weekend festivals. It wasn't where she'd imagined herself when she graduated with honors in journalism, dreaming of hard-hitting investigative pieces and front-page bylines.

"Winters!" The booming voice of her editor, Marcus, cut through the newsroom chatter. "My office, now."

Leo's stomach clenched as she made her way across the room, feeling the eyes of her colleagues following her. The scent of stale coffee and printer toner filled her nostrils as she navigated between desks. She knew what they thought—that she lacked the backbone for real journalism, that she was content with safe, unchallenging assignments. The worst part was, they weren't entirely wrong.

Marcus didn't look up from his computer when she entered. His office smelled of mint gum and the faint trace of the cigarettes he'd supposedly quit last year. Photos of his three children lined the bookshelf behind him, alongside framed front pages of major stories he'd edited during his twenty-year career.

"The Blackwood Industries scandal—I need someone on it," he said, his fingers still typing rapidly.

Leo's pulse quickened. Blackwood Industries was the city's largest pharmaceutical company, recently implicated in a potential cover-up of dangerous side effects from their bestselling antidepressant, Serenix. It was exactly the kind of story she'd dreamed of covering.

"I—" she began, ready to suggest one of the senior reporters.

"Everyone else is tied up," Marcus interrupted, finally looking at her. His eyes were bloodshot from too many late nights, but still sharp. "This could be big, Winters. Don't screw it up."

"Why me?" Leo asked, surprising herself with the question. "After what happened with the Alderman Wilson story..."

Marcus leaned back in his chair, which creaked under his weight. "That was six months ago. Either you've learned from it, or you haven't. Besides," he added, his voice softening slightly, "I've read your drafts before you water them down. You've got good instincts when you trust them."

Back at her desk, Leo stared at her blank screen, panic rising in her chest. The last time she'd been assigned a controversial story—an exposé on a local politician—she'd backed down at the first sign of resistance, accepting the politician's sanitized statement rather than pushing for the truth. The resulting article had been bland and toothless, earning her Marcus's disappointment and cementing her reputation as a reporter without the courage to chase a real story.

"You look like you've seen a ghost," came a voice from beside her.

Leo looked up to see Audrey Chen, the paper's star investigative reporter. At thirty-five, Audrey had built a reputation for fearless reporting and impeccable sources. She was everything Leo aspired to be but feared she never would. Today, Audrey's usual confident posture seemed slightly diminished, and Leo noticed a small bandage on her hand.

"Marcus assigned me the Blackwood story," Leo admitted.

Audrey raised an eyebrow. "That's a big one. Nervous?"

"Terrified," Leo confessed. "I don't have your courage, Audrey. I freeze up when sources get defensive or when I need to ask the tough questions."

"You think I don't get scared?" Audrey asked, lowering her voice. "Last week I interviewed a gang leader for that series on youth violence. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely write notes."

Leo blinked in surprise. "But you always seem so fearless."

Audrey studied her for a moment, then reached into her pocket. "Wait here," she said, before disappearing to her desk across the newsroom. When she returned, she pressed something small and cool into Leo's palm.

It was a smooth stone pendant on a simple leather cord, deep blue with flecks of gold that caught the light. It looked ancient and somehow significant.

"What's this?" Leo asked, turning it over in her hand. The stone was cool against her skin but seemed to warm quickly.

"My grandmother gave it to me when I started in journalism," Audrey said, her voice uncharacteristically solemn. "It's a courage talisman. She said it belonged to a war correspondent in World War II who never backed down from reporting the truth, even under enemy fire."

Leo looked up skeptically. "You don't strike me as someone who believes in lucky charms."

"I don't," Audrey smiled. "But I wore it for my first big story, and somehow, knowing it had belonged to someone brave made me braver too." She closed Leo's fingers around the pendant. "It's yours now. Maybe it'll help you find your courage."

Leo wanted to protest that she couldn't accept something so personal, but Audrey was already walking away. "The Blackwood CEO is holding a press conference at 2 PM," she called over her shoulder. "Don't be late. And Leo—" she turned back briefly, "I've heard rumors they're rushing approval for a pediatric version of Serenix. If the adult formula is dangerous..."

The implication hung in the air between them. Children could be at risk.

---

Leo spent the next few hours researching Blackwood Industries and their controversial antidepressant. She discovered that Serenix had become the company's flagship product, accounting for nearly 40% of their annual revenue. The pediatric version, pending FDA approval, was projected to add another $300 million in yearly sales.

She also found a medical journal article questioning some of the original trial data, written by a Dr. Eleanor Reed, formerly of Blackwood's research division. The article had received little attention when published three months ago, but contained troubling questions about methodology.

Leo made a few calls, leaving messages for Dr. Reed and several other researchers named in the article. Just before heading to the press conference, she received an email from a medical researcher who'd worked briefly at Blackwood. Attached were several internal documents suggesting the company had selectively reported trial results, omitting concerning data points.

The press conference was packed with reporters from every major outlet in the city. The hotel ballroom buzzed with conversation, smelling of cologne, perfume, and the faint mustiness of the aging carpet. Leo fingered the pendant around her neck nervously as Richard Blackwood, the company's silver-haired CEO, took the podium with practiced confidence. His tailored suit and perfect smile projected an image of absolute control.

"Blackwood Industries has always prioritized patient safety," he began smoothly. "The allegations against our product are baseless and will be proven so in due course."

The questions began, and Leo found herself shrinking back, intimidated by the aggressive shouting of the veteran reporters. Then she felt the weight of the pendant against her chest and remembered Audrey's words. Taking a deep breath, she raised her hand.

To her surprise, Blackwood pointed to her. "Yes, the young lady in the back."

"Leo Winters, Chicago Tribune," she said, her voice steadier than she expected. "Internal documents suggest your company was aware of severe neurological side effects in clinical trials but omitted them from your FDA submission. Can you address these specific allegations?"

A flicker of surprise crossed Blackwood's face before his corporate smile returned. For just a moment, his eyes hardened, and Leo caught a glimpse of something cold beneath the polished exterior.

"I'm not familiar with the documents you're referencing. All our trial data was properly submitted," he replied, his tone dismissive but his gaze fixed intently on Leo.

"I have copies," Leo said, surprising herself with her boldness as she held up a folder. "They include emails from your head of research expressing concerns that were apparently ignored. And I'm particularly interested in how these issues might affect the pediatric version of Serenix currently awaiting approval."

A murmur rippled through the room. Several reporters turned to look at her with newfound interest. Blackwood's smile tightened, and he exchanged a quick glance with a stern-looking woman standing to the side, whom Leo recognized as Patricia Vance, Blackwood's chief legal counsel.

"This press conference is over," he announced, as his PR team quickly ushered him away. As he passed near Leo, he paused briefly. "Careful, Ms. Winters," he said quietly. "Unfounded accusations can have serious consequences."

Outside, Leo's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: "Brave questions. There's more to the story. Parking garage, level B, 8 PM tonight."

Leo stared at the message, her heart racing. Meeting an anonymous source in a deserted parking garage after dark? Every instinct told her to forward the message to a more experienced reporter. But as she touched the pendant again, she made a decision.

Back at the Tribune, Leo found Marcus waiting at her desk.

"Blackwood's lawyers just called," he said, his expression grim. "They're threatening a lawsuit if we publish anything based on 'stolen internal documents.'"

Leo's confidence wavered. "I didn't steal anything. A source provided—"

"I know," Marcus interrupted. "But they're playing hardball. This is a multi-billion-dollar company with an army of lawyers." He studied her face. "Are you sure you want to pursue this? I can reassign it."

Leo touched the pendant. "I'm sure."

Marcus nodded, a hint of approval in his eyes. "Then you'd better make it airtight. No assumptions, no exaggerations. Just facts they can't dispute." He turned to leave, then added, "And Winters? Be careful. Companies like Blackwood don't play fair when they're cornered."

---

The parking garage was dimly lit and eerily quiet when Leo arrived that evening. The concrete walls amplified every sound—the drip of water from a leaking pipe, the distant hum of the ventilation system, the echo of her own footsteps. She clutched her pepper spray in one hand and her phone in the other, ready to call for help.

"Ms. Winters," came a voice from the shadows. A middle-aged woman stepped forward, her face tense with anxiety. She wore a rumpled blazer and carried a worn leather briefcase. "I'm Dr. Eleanor Reed, former head of clinical research at Blackwood."

"You're the one who sent the warning emails," Leo realized.

Dr. Reed nodded, glancing nervously around the garage. "They fired me when I refused to sign off on the manipulated data. But I kept copies of everything." She handed Leo a flash drive. "The side effects weren't just headaches and dizziness like they claimed. We had cases of seizures, permanent tremors, even a few suspected deaths that were classified as 'unrelated to treatment.'"

"Why are you coming forward now?" Leo asked.

"Because they're about to release a pediatric version," Dr. Reed said grimly. "I can't let them give this to children. The developing brain is even more vulnerable to Serenix's neurotoxic effects." Her hands trembled slightly as she spoke. "I've spent twenty years in pharmaceutical research. I've never seen such blatant disregard for patient safety."

"What about Richard Blackwood himself? Was he aware of these issues?" Leo asked.

Dr. Reed's expression hardened. "Blackwood isn't just aware—he personally directed the cover-up. I have an email where he instructs the research team to 'reframe' the concerning data. He wrote, and I quote, 'The pediatric market is too valuable to lose over a few anomalous results.'"

As they talked, Leo didn't notice the security guard approaching until he was almost upon them. "This area is closed after hours," he said gruffly, shining his flashlight in their faces.

"We were just leaving," Leo said quickly, tucking the flash drive into her pocket.

But as they walked toward the exit, Leo noticed the guard speaking urgently into his radio. Moments later, two men in suits appeared at the garage entrance. The fluorescent lights glinted off something metallic at one man's hip—a gun holster.

"Dr. Reed," one called out. "Mr. Blackwood would like a word."

Dr. Reed froze. "They're Blackwood security," she whispered to Leo. "They've been following me."

Leo's instinct was to run, to hand over this dangerous story to someone more capable. But then she felt the weight of the pendant and thought of all the patients who might be harmed without this information coming to light. She thought of the children who would soon be prescribed Serenix if she didn't act.

"Follow my lead," she whispered to Dr. Reed, then loudly called out, "Thanks for the interview about your new research position! I'll be in touch if I have more questions."

She guided Dr. Reed toward a different exit, walking confidently as if they had nothing to hide. The men hesitated, clearly uncertain if they had the right person.

"Ma'am," one called out. "We need to verify your identity."

"I'm sorry, but we're late for dinner," Leo replied without stopping. "If Blackwood Industries has questions, they can contact the Tribune's legal department."

They reached Leo's car, hearts pounding. As they drove away, Leo caught sight of the men in her rearview mirror, speaking urgently into their phones.

Once safely on the road, Dr. Reed exhaled shakily. "They would have taken the evidence and made sure I never spoke to another reporter."

"You're safe now," Leo assured her, though her own hands were trembling on the steering wheel. "And your story will be told."

---

Over the next week, Leo worked tirelessly on the Blackwood story. Each morning, she arrived at the Tribune before dawn, the newsroom quiet except for the cleaning staff. Each night, she left long after most of her colleagues had gone home.

She dug through Dr. Reed's files, corroborating details with other sources, and building an airtight case. She interviewed three former patients who had experienced severe side effects, including a 32-year-old teacher now suffering from permanent tremors that had ended her career.

The deeper she dug, the more disturbing the story became. Blackwood had not only concealed data but had actively pressured researchers to manipulate results. They had paid doctors to promote Serenix while downplaying concerns. And Richard Blackwood himself had personally lobbied FDA officials to fast-track the pediatric version despite internal warnings.

Each time she felt her courage wavering—when Blackwood's lawyers sent threatening letters to the Tribune, when she received anonymous phone calls warning her to drop the story, when her apartment showed signs of having been searched—she touched the pendant and pushed forward.

Marcus proved surprisingly supportive, assigning a fact-checker and the paper's best legal reviewer to work with her. "This is the kind of story that reminds me why I got into journalism," he told her one late night, bringing her coffee as she worked. "My daughter was prescribed antidepressants last year," he added quietly. "Stories like this matter."

The night before publication, Leo found Audrey working late at her desk.

"I wanted to thank you," Leo said, fingering the pendant. "This talisman really worked. I've never felt so brave."

Audrey smiled. "I read your draft. It's excellent work."

"I couldn't have done it without this," Leo said, starting to remove the pendant. "You should have it back now."

"Keep it," Audrey said. "But there's something you should know." She hesitated. "That story about the war correspondent? I made it up."

Leo stared at her. "What?"

"The pendant was just something I bought at a street fair when I first started here," Audrey admitted. "I saw how talented you were, but also how you held yourself back. You didn't need a magic talisman, Leo. You just needed to believe in yourself."

Leo looked down at the pendant, processing this revelation. "So all this time..."

"The courage was yours all along," Audrey said simply. "The pendant just gave you permission to use it."

Leo was quiet for a moment. "You know, when Blackwood's security confronted us in the garage, I was terrified. But I kept thinking about what would happen if I didn't get that story out—all those children who could be harmed." She looked up at Audrey. "Maybe that's what courage is—being afraid but doing it anyway because something matters more than the fear."

Audrey nodded. "That's exactly what it is."

The next morning, Leo's exposé on Blackwood Industries ran as the front-page headline: "DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS CONCEALED: BLACKWOOD'S SERENIX PUTS PROFITS OVER PATIENTS." The article detailed the company's systematic cover-up, including Richard Blackwood's direct involvement and the rush to approve a potentially dangerous pediatric version.

By afternoon, the FDA had announced an investigation, and Blackwood's stock was in freefall. News channels were running the story, with several featuring interviews with Dr. Reed and the patients Leo had spoken with.

Richard Blackwood held an emergency press conference, his usual polish noticeably absent. "These allegations are—" he began, but reporters interrupted with questions drawn directly from Leo's article. For the first time, the CEO appeared rattled, his carefully constructed facade crumbling under the weight of the evidence against him.

As congratulations poured in from colleagues who had previously dismissed her, Leo sat quietly at her desk, turning the pendant over in her hands. It wasn't magical after all, just a pretty stone on a string. Yet it had changed everything.

Marcus stopped by her desk, a rare smile on his face. "Impressive work, Winters. The FDA commissioner just announced they're halting review of the pediatric application pending a full investigation." He paused. "I've got another lead for you—potential safety violations at that new nuclear plant upstate. Interested?"

A month ago, such an assignment would have terrified her. Now, Leo nodded confidently. "Absolutely."

As Marcus walked away, Leo slipped the pendant into her desk drawer. She wouldn't be needing it anymore. The courage had been hers all along; she had simply needed to find it. And now that she had, there was no story too daunting, no truth she wasn't brave enough to pursue.

She opened a new document and began to type, ready for whatever challenge came next. Outside her window, the Chicago skyline stretched toward the clouds, a city full of stories waiting to be told by someone brave enough to tell them.
