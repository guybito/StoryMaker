## Analysis Report
"The Ghost of Vengeance" presents a well-structured revenge narrative with clear characters and strong conflict. The story effectively blends elements of psychological thriller with hints of supernatural horror, creating tension through the ambiguity between real and perceived threats. Walter Chen serves as a sympathetic protagonist whose ordinary hobby leads him into extraordinary danger. The narrative maintains logical consistency and resolves its central conflicts satisfactorily, though character development and sensory descriptions could be enhanced to create a more immersive experience.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen character development**: Provide more insight into Walter's personal history and inner life beyond his collecting hobby. What drives his ethical stance? How did his past shape his response to threats? This would make his transformation more meaningful.

* **Enhance sensory details**: Add more vivid descriptions of settings, physical sensations, and atmospheric elements to make scenes more immersive. The "haunting" sequences especially would benefit from richer sensory language.

* **Explore moral complexity**: Delve deeper into the ethical questions raised by the story. Walter is positioned as entirely in the right, but exploring some ambiguity or self-doubt would add depth to the themes of justice and revenge.

* **Strengthen the connection between plot elements**: More clearly establish how the silver box connects to Michael's revenge plan. The coincidental timing creates an interesting parallel, but a stronger narrative link would tighten the plot.

* **Provide more plausible explanations for complex plot points**: Offer more detailed explanations for how Michael managed his prison escape and elaborate deception, which would strengthen the story's internal logic.
