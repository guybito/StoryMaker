## Short Report
"The Reluctant Impersonator" presents a compelling character-driven narrative with a strong moral arc. Harrison Caldwell's transformation from a morally compromised financial analyst to someone seeking redemption is convincingly portrayed through escalating conflicts and meaningful character interactions. The story effectively balances external threats with internal moral struggles, creating tension that drives the narrative forward. While some plot mechanics could be better explained and settings more vividly rendered, the overall craft is strong, with clear prose and purposeful storytelling.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Develop the supporting characters further** - While Alice and Benjamin serve their narrative functions well, providing more depth to their characters (especially Alice's background and motivations) would strengthen the story's emotional impact and thematic resonance.

* **Clarify logistical details** - Some elements like how Alice tracked Harrison down, the specifics of the towns, and the mechanics of creating a convincing disguise could be better explained to enhance plausibility.

* **Enrich the settings with more sensory details** - The physical environments could be more vividly rendered to create a stronger sense of place and atmosphere, particularly in key locations like Benjamin's office and the towns Harrison passes through.

* **Expand on Harrison's relationship with his brother** - Since his brother's gambling debts triggered the entire chain of events, exploring this relationship would add emotional depth and further justify Harrison's initial moral compromise.

* **Provide more concrete details about Benjamin's comeuppance** - The resolution could be strengthened by specifying the charges against Benjamin and showing more directly how Harrison's testimony contributes to justice being served.
