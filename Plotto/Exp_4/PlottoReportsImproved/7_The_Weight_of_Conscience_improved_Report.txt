## Overall Weighted Score: 3.87

## Report:
"The Weight of Conscience" is an exceptionally well-crafted story that excels in all evaluation categories. The protagonist's moral journey is rendered with psychological depth and emotional authenticity, while supporting characters serve clear narrative functions. The central ethical conflict creates compelling tension that builds organically toward resolution. The writing demonstrates technical excellence with vivid descriptions and purposeful details, while maintaining logical consistency throughout the narrative.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
* Consider exploring Blake's character more directly through scenes rather than retrospective description, which would strengthen the emotional impact of his death and Gabriel's subsequent guilt.
* The resolution of the legal consequences feels somewhat condensed compared to the detailed buildup of the ethical dilemma; expanding this section could provide a more balanced narrative structure.
* While the ambiguity around Blake's death is intentional, providing slightly more concrete details about the investigation would give readers a more satisfying sense of closure while still maintaining some mystery.
