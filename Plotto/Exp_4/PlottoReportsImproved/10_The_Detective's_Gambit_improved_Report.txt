## Summary Report
"The Detective's Gambit" is an exceptionally well-crafted detective story that skillfully balances character development with engaging plot. The protagonist's journey from financial desperation to moral integrity is convincingly portrayed through a compelling corporate espionage case. The narrative excels in establishing clear stakes, consistent conflict, and satisfying character arcs while maintaining logical coherence. The writing is polished and professional, with strong attention to descriptive detail and pacing.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
* **Deepen the visual descriptions of key scenes** - While the office and character descriptions are strong, some pivotal moments (like the park meeting with Paige) could benefit from more sensory details to enhance immersion.
* **Strengthen the logic behind some plot developments** - Provide more detail about how Isaac gained access to Paige's building and convinced board members to listen to his allegations against a senior executive.
* **Show more of Isaac's internal struggle** - While his moral dilemma is clear, more moments revealing his thought process during key decisions would strengthen the emotional impact of his ultimate choice.
* **Develop the technical aspects of the case** - The nature of the algorithms and evidence could be more specifically described to increase the authenticity of the corporate espionage plot.
