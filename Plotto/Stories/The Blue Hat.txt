# *The Blue Hat*
Tom woke up one morning and decided he needed a new hat. He looked in his drawer, but there were only socks. So he went outside and walked to the store.

On the way, he saw a dog. The dog barked. Tom ignored it.

At the store, he asked for a hat. The clerk gave him a blue one. It was too small. Tom didn't mind.

He wore the hat and walked home.

When he got home, he made a sandwich.

Then it rained.

Tom took off the hat and went to sleep.
