## Summary Report:
"Beneath the Cypress Shadows" is an accomplished environmental thriller that skillfully combines family drama with ecological stakes. The story excels in character development, particularly in the complex relationship between Jackson and Dominic, while maintaining strong narrative tension through escalating conflicts. The Everglades setting is vividly rendered with authentic details that enhance both atmosphere and plot. While some elements of the Lily/Mamma Cypress disguise stretch credibility, the overall narrative logic remains sound and engaging.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character physicality**: While Jackson is described as having a "weathered face," other characters could benefit from more consistent physical descriptions to help readers visualize them throughout the story.

* **Scientific specificity**: The medicinal properties and weaponization potential of the Ghost Orchids could be explained with more specific details to strengthen the scientific foundation of the plot.

* **Lily's disguise logistics**: The practicality of maintaining an elderly disguise for three years requires more explanation to enhance credibilityâ€”perhaps addressing how she managed daily life or interactions with people who knew the real Mamma Cypress.

* **Climactic timing**: The arrival of the mercenaries and fire-setting could be foreshadowed earlier to make their appearance at the critical moment feel less convenient to the plot structure.

* **Resolution pacing**: The three-month time jump in the epilogue feels somewhat abruptâ€”a brief transitional scene showing the immediate aftermath of the escape might provide a smoother narrative arc.
