# *The Reflection of Beauty*

Sienna Matthews had always believed she was beautiful. Not just pretty or attractive, but genuinely, head-turningly beautiful. This conviction had formed the cornerstone of her identity since childhood, despite the fact that by conventional standards, she was decidedly plain. Her mousy brown hair lacked luster, her features were unremarkable, and her figure was average at best. Yet somehow, when Sienna looked in the mirror, she saw someone else entirely—someone with radiant skin, captivating eyes, and an ethereal presence.

This disconnect between perception and reality had been carefully cultivated by her mother, Zara. A former beauty queen whose own looks had faded with time, Zara had transferred her vanity and ambitions onto her only daughter. "You're the most beautiful girl in any room," she would whisper to Sienna before school events. "They're all just jealous of you." These affirmations, repeated throughout Sienna's formative years, had calcified into an unshakable belief system.

At twenty-eight, Sienna worked as a junior marketing executive at a mid-sized cosmetics company in Chicago. She had been there for five years with minimal advancement, a situation she attributed to jealousy from her female superiors and unwanted attention from male colleagues. The truth—that her perpetual frown, constant complaints, and tendency to take credit for others' work made her difficult to promote—remained invisible to her.

"They'll recognize my talents eventually," Sienna muttered to herself as she aggressively stirred her morning coffee in the break room. Her colleague, Daphne, offered a tight smile before quickly exiting. Sienna interpreted this as another example of intimidation rather than what it actually was: avoidance.

Sienna's apartment was a shrine to her perceived beauty—multiple mirrors strategically placed to catch her reflection at flattering angles, shelves crowded with expensive beauty products, and a closet full of clothes one size too small that she was perpetually "about to fit into." The reality of her financial struggles—credit card debt mounting from unnecessary purchases and a salary that hadn't increased in years—was another truth she refused to acknowledge.

Her mother, Zara, now sixty-three, remained her most steadfast supporter and enabler. Their Sunday brunches were ritual affirmation sessions where Zara would reinforce Sienna's distorted self-image while criticizing everyone else in their orbit.

"Did you see how that waitress looked at you?" Zara whispered during one such brunch. "Pure envy. You should complain about her service."

Sienna nodded, scanning the restaurant for admirers she believed must be watching her. "I think I'm going to apply for the senior marketing position that just opened up," she announced. "It's about time they recognized my potential."

Zara beamed with pride. "Of course you should! You're the most qualified person there."

What neither of them acknowledged was that Sienna had been passed over for three promotions already, each time responding with increasingly bitter complaints to HR rather than self-reflection.

The following week, a deadly flu outbreak hit Chicago. The virus spread rapidly, overwhelming hospitals and causing widespread panic. When the illness struck Miles Abernathy, the elderly man who lived across the hall from Sienna, the entire building's residents retreated in fear. Miles had no family nearby, and the building manager posted a desperate plea for someone to check on him, as emergency services were stretched beyond capacity.

Sienna, passing the notice in the lobby, paused. Despite her many flaws, she had always harbored a genuine belief in being special—not just in appearance, but in purpose. Here was an opportunity to prove her exceptional nature to everyone.

"I'll do it," she told the surprised building manager. "I'll look after Mr. Abernathy."

The manager, a practical woman named Gloria, eyed her skeptically. "This isn't a game, Sienna. The virus is highly contagious, and Miles is very ill. The health department has advised minimal contact."

"I understand the risks," Sienna replied, already imagining the admiration she would receive. "Someone has to help him."

That evening, armed with disinfectant, masks, and gloves provided by Gloria, Sienna knocked on Miles's door. The weak "come in" that followed revealed the gravity of his condition.

Miles Abernathy's apartment was sparse but meticulously organized—the home of a man who valued function over form. Now, however, it was clear he had been unable to care for himself for days. Dishes were piled in the sink, and the air was stale with sickness.

Miles himself was a frail figure huddled under blankets on his couch, his breathing labored and his eyes glassy with fever. At seventy-eight, he had the distinguished look of a former academic, which indeed he had been—a professor of philosophy now long retired.

"Ms. Matthews," he wheezed, recognizing her from their infrequent elevator encounters. "You shouldn't be here. It's not safe."

"Nonsense," Sienna replied, setting down her supplies. "Everyone else is too afraid, but I'm not. I'm going to help you get better."

Over the next three days, Sienna established a routine. She would visit Miles three times daily—morning, afternoon, and evening—to provide medication, food, and basic care. She documented her efforts meticulously on social media, carefully framing herself as the building's selfless hero.

What surprised her was how Miles, even in his weakened state, treated her. Unlike most people who seemed put off by her fretful disposition, Miles spoke to her with genuine interest and respect. He asked questions about her life and actually listened to her answers without the usual glazing of eyes she encountered elsewhere.

On the fourth day, as Miles's fever finally broke, Sienna arrived to find him sitting up and alert for the first time.

"You've been very kind," he said, his voice stronger than before. "May I ask why you volunteered when no one else would?"

The question caught Sienna off guard. Her rehearsed response about civic duty suddenly felt hollow. "I... I suppose I wanted to prove I could do something important," she admitted.

Miles nodded thoughtfully. "And have you proven it?"

"I'm not sure," Sienna said, realizing with some surprise that the social media validation she'd been receiving felt increasingly empty compared to the actual experience of helping someone.

As Miles recovered, their conversations deepened. A former ethics professor, he gently challenged Sienna's perspectives without ever directly criticizing her. For perhaps the first time in her adult life, Sienna found herself engaged in conversations that weren't centered on her appearance or grievances.

One evening, as she was preparing to leave after delivering Miles's dinner, she overheard him speaking on the phone in his bedroom, the door slightly ajar.

"Yes, she's still coming by," Miles was saying. "No, Gloria, she's nothing like you described. Beneath all that fretfulness, there's someone quite different trying to emerge."

Sienna froze, realizing they were discussing her.

"The constant complaints and self-absorption—it's all armor," Miles continued. "She's been told her whole life that her value lies in a beauty she doesn't possess, so she's created this entire persona to protect herself from that truth. It's making her miserable, and everyone around her too. But these past days, when she forgets to maintain the facade... there's a thoughtful, capable person there."

Sienna backed away silently, her cheeks burning with shame and anger. Her first instinct was to storm in and defend herself, to accuse Miles of betrayal after all she'd done for him. Instead, she quietly gathered her things and left, the words echoing painfully in her mind.

That night, Sienna couldn't sleep. She paced her apartment, alternating between rage and an unfamiliar feeling of hollow uncertainty. Around dawn, exhausted, she found herself staring at her reflection in her bedroom mirror—really staring, perhaps for the first time in years.

What she saw was not the goddess her mother had convinced her she was, nor was she the plain, unremarkable woman others might describe. She was simply Sienna—a woman whose perpetual dissatisfaction had etched premature lines around her mouth, whose eyes reflected not beauty but a desperate need for validation.

"Who am I without this?" she whispered to her reflection, touching the elaborate makeup she applied even before bed.

The next morning, Sienna called in sick to work—something she never did, priding herself on perfect attendance. Instead, she visited her mother's apartment unannounced.

Zara opened the door in a silk robe, her face covered in an expensive cream. "Sienna! What are you doing here? Is everything alright?"

"We need to talk, Mom," Sienna said quietly, stepping inside.

The conversation that followed was painful for both of them. Sienna confronted her mother about the lifetime of false affirmations, the unrealistic expectations, and the constant reinforcement of vanity over substance.

"Why did you do it?" Sienna finally asked, her voice breaking. "Why make me believe I was something I'm not?"

Zara, stripped of her usual bravado, looked suddenly old and vulnerable. "Because I couldn't bear for you to feel ordinary," she admitted. "I was ordinary, and it broke me. I thought I was protecting you."

"But you weren't," Sienna replied. "You were setting me up for a lifetime of disappointment."

When Sienna returned to Miles's apartment that afternoon, she looked different. She had washed off her heavy makeup and pulled her hair back simply. Miles, now able to move around his apartment with assistance, noticed immediately but said nothing.

"I heard what you said about me on the phone," Sienna said without preamble. "You were right."

Miles nodded slowly. "I'm sorry you had to hear it that way."

"I'm not," Sienna replied. "I needed to hear it. I've been making myself and everyone around me miserable because I couldn't accept who I really am."

Over the next two weeks, as Miles continued to recover, Sienna underwent her own transformation. She began to recognize how her fretful disposition and constant complaints had alienated colleagues and potential friends. She started listening more than speaking, observing more than demanding attention.

At work, she approached her supervisor with a new attitude, asking for specific feedback on how she could improve rather than complaining about being overlooked. The change was so dramatic that her team began cautiously including her in projects and social events.

But as Miles improved, Sienna began to feel increasingly unwell. At first, she dismissed it as exhaustion from her caregiving duties. Then came the fever, the aching joints, the difficulty breathing. She had contracted the virus despite her precautions.

Unlike Miles, whose symptoms had eventually plateaued, Sienna's condition deteriorated rapidly. Her compromised immune system—weakened by years of crash diets and stress—couldn't fight the infection effectively. Within days, she was hospitalized in critical condition.

From her hospital bed, drifting in and out of consciousness, Sienna experienced a clarity that had eluded her in health. The doctors were not optimistic about her chances, and she knew it. Yet strangely, she felt at peace. In her final days, she had glimpsed who she could have been without the burden of false ideals—someone capable of genuine connection, of meaningful contribution.

Miles, now recovered enough to leave his apartment, visited her daily, reading to her from philosophy texts when she was conscious enough to listen. Her mother, Zara, sat vigil by her bedside, her makeup washed away by tears, finally seeing her daughter clearly.

On her last lucid day, Sienna managed to speak to them both. "I was wrong about so many things," she whispered. "But in the end, I got to be the person I should have been all along. That's something, isn't it?"

Three days later, Sienna Matthews died from complications of the virus. The funeral was small but attended by more people than might have been expected a month earlier—colleagues who had glimpsed a different Sienna in her final weeks, neighbors touched by her sacrifice for Miles, and even Gloria, the building manager who had witnessed her transformation.

Miles, still weak but determined to honor her, delivered a eulogy that captured not who Sienna had been for most of her life, but who she had become at the end.

"Sienna Matthews discovered something many of us never do," he said, his voice steady despite his grief. "She learned that true beauty lies not in appearance or in the validation of others, but in the courage to see oneself clearly and choose to change. In her final act of service, she found the ideals worth cherishing—compassion, honesty, and the capacity for growth. She may have left us too soon, but she left having corrected the error that defined her life. There is profound beauty in that."

As the small gathering dispersed, Zara approached Miles, her face bare of makeup for the first time in decades. "Thank you," she said simply. "For helping her see what I couldn't show her."

Miles nodded, understanding the complex grief of a mother who had loved imperfectly but completely. "She helped me too," he replied. "More than she ever knew."

In death, Sienna Matthews finally achieved what had eluded her in life—she became truly beautiful, not by the standards she had desperately pursued, but by the measure of a life, however brief, that had ultimately found its truth.
