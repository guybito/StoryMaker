# *The Facets of Deception*

The first rays of dawn filtered through the dense pine forest surrounding Blackwater Logging Camp, casting long shadows across the muddy ground. Elias Thorne hunched over his workbench in a small cabin at the edge of the camp, his weathered hands delicately turning a rough piece of agate. At forty-two, Elias had the sturdy build of someone who had spent years in physical labor before finding his true calling as a lapidarist—a craftsman who cuts, polishes, and engraves precious stones.

His fingers, once calloused from wielding an axe, now possessed an artist's sensitivity. Each stone he transformed told a story—much like the one he himself carried but rarely shared. The cabin's walls were lined with shelves displaying his creations: pendants, brooches, and decorative pieces that captured the hidden beauty within ordinary rocks. This remote logging camp in the Pacific Northwest had become his sanctuary after leaving behind a complicated past in Seattle.

A sharp knock interrupted his concentration. "Come in," he called, setting down his tools.

The door swung open to reveal Marcus Reeves, a factory worker from the nearby lumber mill who had become Elias's closest friend in the three years since he'd arrived at Blackwater. Marcus was younger by a decade, with a perpetual five o'clock shadow and eyes that crinkled when he smiled.

"Morning, stone whisperer," Marcus said, the nickname he'd given Elias when they first met. "Thought you might want some coffee before the town meeting."

Elias accepted the steaming mug gratefully. "Thanks. I'd forgotten about the meeting."

"How could you forget? It's all anyone's talking about. Three disappearances in two months isn't normal, even for a place as remote as this." Marcus leaned against the doorframe, his expression serious. "People are scared, Elias."

The disappearances had begun with a young logger named Tyler, followed by one of the camp cooks, and most recently, the camp manager's assistant. Each had vanished without a trace while walking alone through the forest. Some blamed wild animals; others whispered about something more sinister.

"The sheriff's getting nowhere," Marcus continued. "That's why they're bringing in someone from the state police today."

Elias felt a knot form in his stomach. Outside attention was the last thing he wanted. "I suppose it's necessary," he said carefully.

"You're still coming to the meeting, right? People respect you, Elias. Your voice matters."

Elias nodded reluctantly. "I'll be there."

After Marcus left, Elias opened the small lockbox he kept hidden beneath a loose floorboard. Inside lay a worn photograph of a young woman with his eyes and a newspaper clipping with the headline: "Jewelry Store Heist Leaves One Dead, Suspect At Large." The date on the clipping was from seven years ago.

The community hall was packed when Elias arrived. He slipped into a seat beside Marcus near the back, nodding to familiar faces. Sheriff Dawson stood at the front, alongside a woman in plain clothes whom Elias assumed was the state investigator.

"Folks, this is Detective Claire Harmon," the sheriff announced. "She'll be leading the investigation into the disappearances."

Detective Harmon stepped forward. She was in her late thirties with sharp, observant eyes that seemed to miss nothing. "I understand your community is close-knit," she began. "Which means you know each other's habits, routines, and secrets. I need your help to find out what happened to your missing neighbors."

Her gaze swept the room, pausing momentarily on Elias. He felt a chill run through him.

"I'll be conducting interviews starting tomorrow," she continued. "In the meantime, no one should venture into the forest alone."

After the meeting, Marcus caught up with Elias outside. "She seems competent," he remarked.

"Too competent," Elias muttered.

Marcus gave him a curious look. "Something wrong?"

Elias forced a smile. "Just worried about the camp. These disappearances are bad for everyone."

"Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something," Marcus said, lowering his voice. "I found something strange near the old logging road yesterday." He pulled out his phone and showed Elias a photo of what appeared to be an abandoned campsite with unusual markings carved into nearby trees.

"I didn't tell the sheriff yet," Marcus explained. "Thought maybe we could check it out first. Your eyes might spot something I missed."

Elias hesitated. Getting involved was risky, but refusing would raise questions. "Tomorrow morning," he agreed. "Before the detective starts her interviews."

The following day, Elias and Marcus hiked to the abandoned campsite. The markings on the trees were unlike anything Elias had seen before—intricate spirals and angular symbols that seemed to point deeper into the forest.

"What do you make of it?" Marcus asked.

Before Elias could answer, they heard a twig snap behind them. They turned to find Detective Harmon watching them, her expression unreadable.

"Interesting place for a morning walk," she said coolly.

Marcus explained their discovery, showing her the markings. To Elias's surprise, she seemed genuinely interested rather than suspicious.

"These could be significant," she admitted. "But you should have reported this immediately, not investigated on your own."

"That's my fault," Elias said. "I was curious."

Detective Harmon studied him. "Mr. Thorne, isn't it? The lapidarist. I'd like to speak with you privately when we return to camp."

The walk back was tense. When they reached the camp, Marcus was sent to fetch the sheriff while Detective Harmon led Elias to the small office she'd been given.

"Your work is quite remarkable," she said, gesturing for him to sit. "I saw some pieces in the camp manager's home. You have a gift."

"Thank you," Elias replied cautiously.

"It's interesting that someone with your talent would choose such an isolated place to practice it." She opened a folder on her desk. "Especially someone with no record of formal training or previous employment in the field."

Elias's heart raced. "I'm self-taught. Needed a change after years of construction work."

"Construction?" She raised an eyebrow. "Not jewelry design in Seattle?"

The room seemed to grow smaller. "You've been investigating me."

"I investigate everyone in a case like this." Her voice hardened. "But most people don't use aliases, Mr. Thorne. Or should I say, Mr. Garrett?"

The name he'd abandoned seven years ago hit him like a physical blow. "What do you want?"

"The truth. Are you connected to these disappearances?"

"No!" Elias stood abruptly. "I came here to escape my past, not to hurt anyone."

"Your past as a jeweler whose store was robbed, resulting in your partner's death? Or your past as the prime suspect who vanished afterward?"

"I didn't kill James," Elias said quietly. "The real killer threatened my daughter if I didn't take the blame and disappear. I've been hiding ever since to protect her."

Detective Harmon's expression softened slightly. "Your daughter thinks you're dead, Mr. Garrett. The case went cold years ago."

The revelation struck Elias like lightning. "She thinks I'm dead?"

"It was safer that way," came a voice from the doorway.

They turned to see Marcus, his familiar face now cold and unfamiliar. In his hand was a gun, pointed steadily at Detective Harmon.

"Marcus?" Elias whispered in disbelief.

"Not exactly," he replied. "Though I've grown fond of that name. You knew me briefly as the man who robbed your store and killed your partner, Elias. But we've become such good friends since then, haven't we?"

---

The truth unfolded like a nightmare. Marcus—whose real name was Vincent Keller—had tracked Elias to Blackwater three years ago. He'd orchestrated a chance meeting and cultivated their friendship while monitoring Elias to ensure he never contacted his daughter or revealed the truth about the robbery.

"The disappearances," Detective Harmon said, her voice steady despite the gun pointed at her. "That was you creating a diversion to bring me here."

Vincent nodded. "I recognized you from the Seattle police force. You were getting too close to the truth about other cases I was involved in. I needed to eliminate you somewhere remote, where your death could be blamed on the same 'mysterious force' that took the others."

"The others aren't dead," Elias realized aloud. "They're helping you. Paid accomplices."

"Very good," Vincent smiled. "You always were perceptive. That's why I enjoyed our friendship, Elias. It was almost genuine."

"What about my daughter?" Elias demanded. "You said she was safe if I disappeared."

Vincent's expression darkened. "She was. Until she started investigating her father's 'death' last year. Became quite the amateur detective. She's actually here now—arrived this morning. The new cook's assistant? That's her."

Horror washed over Elias. "Emma is here?"

"She doesn't know you're alive yet," Vincent said. "But she's close to figuring it out. Too close. I can't have that."

"What have you done?" Elias lunged forward, but Vincent stepped back, keeping the gun trained on them.

"Nothing yet. But she's currently hiking to that campsite you found, following a note I left suggesting she'd find answers there. Instead, she'll have a tragic accident—unless you convince the detective here to drop her investigation and leave town immediately."

Detective Harmon's eyes met Elias's. "He's lying," she said calmly. "Your daughter isn't in danger because she isn't here. I would know—I've been protecting her for years."

Vincent's composure slipped. "You're bluffing."

"Am I? Emma Garrett is currently finishing her second year at the police academy in Seattle. She lives in an apartment with a roommate named Tasha and a cat named Pebble—a nod to her father's work with stones. I know because I've been her mentor since she decided to follow in my footsteps."

Elias felt dizzy with the revelation. His daughter was alive, safe, and becoming a police officer.

Vincent's face contorted with rage. "It doesn't matter. Neither of you is leaving this room alive."

What happened next unfolded in seconds. Vincent aimed his gun at Detective Harmon, but before he could fire, Elias threw himself forward, knocking Vincent's arm upward. The gun discharged into the ceiling. Detective Harmon drew her own weapon, but Vincent had already recovered, using Elias as a shield.

"Drop it," Vincent snarled, pressing his gun to Elias's temple.

To Elias's shock, Detective Harmon lowered her weapon.

"Claire, don't," Elias pleaded.

"I promised Emma I'd find the truth about her father," she said quietly. "I can't fail her now."

Vincent laughed bitterly. "Honor among cops. How touching." He backed toward the door, dragging Elias with him. "We're going to walk out of here. Anyone tries to stop us, he dies."

As they reached the doorway, Vincent made a fatal mistake. He glanced over his shoulder to check the path was clear. In that moment, Elias saw Detective Harmon's slight nod and understood. He went limp suddenly, dropping his weight and throwing Vincent off balance.

The gun went off again, but the bullet struck the doorframe. Detective Harmon lunged forward, tackling Vincent. They struggled briefly before another shot rang out.

Vincent stared in disbelief at the blood spreading across his chest. "I would have killed her," he gasped. "Your precious daughter. I would have found her eventually."

"But you didn't," Detective Harmon said, kicking his gun away. "And now you never will."

As Vincent's life ebbed away, he looked at Elias with something like respect. "You know," he whispered, "I actually did consider you a friend. That's why I never turned you in." His final words were barely audible: "Some lies become their own truth."

Six months later, Elias stood nervously in a Seattle café, watching the door. Detective Harmon—Claire—sat across from him, offering silent support.

"She might not come," Elias said for the tenth time.

"She'll come," Claire assured him. "She's as stubborn as you are."

The door opened, and a young woman entered. She had Elias's eyes and her mother's smile. She scanned the café until her gaze landed on him. For a moment, she froze, and Elias feared she would turn and leave. Then she walked slowly to their table.

"Emma," he said, his voice breaking.

"Dad," she replied, tears welling in her eyes. "It's really you."

As they embraced for the first time in seven years, Elias knew that the path ahead would be difficult. Trust, once broken, wasn't easily repaired. But as Emma pulled back to look at him, he saw not just pain and confusion in her eyes, but also hope.

From his pocket, he withdrew a small box and placed it in her hand. Inside was a pendant—a piece of rough agate he had transformed into a polished gem, revealing the beautiful patterns hidden within.

"Sometimes," he told her, "what appears broken on the surface holds something precious inside. We just need the courage to look deeper."

Emma closed her fingers around the pendant, a small smile forming on her lips. "I think I'm ready to try."
