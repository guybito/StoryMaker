## Report
"Caged Ambitions" presents a compelling narrative about corporate corruption and moral courage with well-developed characters and strong thematic elements. The story excels in establishing clear conflict with meaningful stakes and maintains consistent characterization throughout. The prose is technically proficient and engaging, though some aspects of the resolution rely on convenient plot developments. Overall, this is a well-crafted story that effectively balances character development with plot progression.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen character interiority**: While Daniel's professional motivations are clear, exploring more of his internal struggles and personal history would create a more three-dimensional protagonist. Showing more of his emotional journey would strengthen reader connection.

* **Enhance sensory details**: The zoo setting offers rich opportunities for sensory description that could make scenes more immersive. Adding more specific details about animal sounds, smells, and the physical environment would strengthen the sense of place.

* **Develop a more complex resolution**: The current ending relies somewhat heavily on the convenient intervention of Hargrove's assistant. Developing this character earlier or creating a more challenging path to justice would strengthen the plot's credibility.

* **Expand on supporting character motivations**: While Hargrove and Whitaker serve as effective antagonists, providing more insight into their rationalization for corruption would create more complex villains rather than straightforward bad actors.
