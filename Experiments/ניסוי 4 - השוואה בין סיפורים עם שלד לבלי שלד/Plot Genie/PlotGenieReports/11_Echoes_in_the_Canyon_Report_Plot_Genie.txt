## Overall Weighted Score: 3.6875

## Summary Report:
"Echoes in the Canyon" is an exceptionally well-crafted short story that excels in character development, conflict construction, and writing craft. The narrative successfully balances external plot tension with internal character struggles, creating a compelling story about justice, vengeance, and moral complexity. The southwestern setting is vividly rendered, and the natural disaster serves as both plot device and metaphor. While there are minor issues with some coincidental elements and exposition, the story demonstrates strong professional quality throughout.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Development**: Consider deepening Leila's internal conflict and transformation arc to match Amelia's. While Leila is well-characterized, her emotional journey receives less attention than Amelia's, which would add further dimension to this important supporting character.

* **Plot Mechanics**: The coincidence of all characters converging at the shelter could be strengthened by establishing earlier why Holloway would specifically be at that location, making the confrontation feel more organic and less contrived.

* **Exposition Balance**: Some backstory elements could be more seamlessly integrated into the narrative action rather than presented as explanatory passages, particularly regarding the history of Holloway's corruption and the women's investigation.

* **Stakes Clarification**: While personal stakes are clear, the potential consequences of the women's plan to expose Holloway could be established earlier and more explicitly to heighten tension throughout the story.

* **Secondary Character Resolution**: Consider briefly addressing the fate of secondary characters like Holloway's nephew to provide more complete closure to all narrative threads introduced in the story.
