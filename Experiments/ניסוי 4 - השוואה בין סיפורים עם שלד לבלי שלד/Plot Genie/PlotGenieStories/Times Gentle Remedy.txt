# *Time's Gentle Remedy*

The sun beat down mercilessly on the clay courts of the Roland-Garros tournament. Dr. Elena Kovacs wiped sweat from her brow as she adjusted the specialized equipment in her temporary lab space beneath the stands. As the tournament's consulting chemist, she was responsible for analyzing samples and ensuring no players were using performance-enhancing substances. But her mind wasn't on her work today.

"You're doing that thing again," came a melodic voice from the doorway. "That thing where you pretend to be working but you're actually a million miles away."

Elena looked up to see Margot Beaumont leaning against the doorframe, her wild curls escaping from beneath a colorful headscarf, oversized vintage sunglasses perched on her nose. The French photographer's bohemian style was as unmistakable as her talent for capturing the raw emotion of the sport.

"Just thinking about Sophia," Elena admitted, referring to her younger sister. "The situation back home is getting worse."

Margot's expression softened as she entered the lab, closing the door behind her. The two women had become unlikely friends since meeting at last year's tournament—the precise chemist and the free-spirited artist finding common ground in their shared Eastern European heritage and love of tennis.

"Any news?" Margot asked, perching on a stool.

Elena shook her head. "The new regime is tightening its grip. Anyone with connections to the previous government is being... dealt with." She swallowed hard. "My father was a science minister. Now Sophia's being pressured to publicly denounce him—and me—to keep her university position."

What Elena didn't say was that her sister was being asked to do much more than that. The emails had become increasingly desperate. *They want me to inform on my colleagues, Elena. They're saying it's my patriotic duty.*

"We need to get her out," Margot said simply.

Elena nodded. "The tournament director promised to help. He has connections with the French embassy."

Outside, thunder rumbled ominously. The weather forecast had been threatening the tournament schedule for days, but so far, the rain had held off. Elena glanced at her watch. She had samples to process before the women's quarterfinals.

"Speaking of the director," Margot said, a strange note in her voice, "I saw him with Christophe Renard earlier."

Elena's hands stilled. Christophe Renard—the tournament's head of security and the man who had been occupying far too many of her thoughts lately. Tall, reserved, with intelligent eyes that seemed to see right through her carefully constructed walls.

"They're probably discussing security for the semifinals," Elena said, trying to sound casual.

Margot's knowing smile suggested she wasn't fooled. "He asks about you, you know. When I'm photographing the security briefings."

Elena felt heat rise to her cheeks. "It's complicated."

"It always is with you, chérie."

The truth was more complicated than Elena cared to admit. Her growing feelings for Christophe were a luxury she couldn't afford—not with Sophia's situation growing more dire by the day. And there was another complication: Viktor Lazarov.

Viktor—the man who had once been her mentor at the university in her homeland. The man who had stolen her research on performance-enhancing compounds and published it under his name, destroying her academic reputation and forcing her to flee the country. The man who seemed untouchable, protected by powerful friends in the sports world, earning him the nickname "The Immortal" among bitter colleagues.

And now, Viktor was here at Roland-Garros, serving as a consultant to one of the top-seeded Russian players.

"You're thinking about him again," Margot observed. "The vampire who stole your work."

"He's here to taunt me," Elena said, her voice hardening. "He knows I can't touch him without proof."

"But you have proof now, don't you?" Margot's eyes gleamed behind her sunglasses.

Elena hesitated. She did have proof—emails she'd managed to recover showing Viktor had accessed her research files days before submitting "his" groundbreaking paper. But using it meant risking everything she'd rebuilt. The tournament officials had hired her based on her current reputation, not knowing about the scandal that had forced her to leave her country.

"If I expose him, I could lose this position," Elena said. "And without it, I lose the connections I need to help Sophia."

Margot reached across the lab table and squeezed Elena's hand. "Sometimes justice has to wait."

The first fat raindrops began to hit the windows as Elena's phone chimed with a text. It was from Christophe: *Need to speak with you urgently. Meet me at the administration office.*

---

The administration building was quiet, most staff having relocated to the covered courts where play continued despite the worsening weather. Elena found Christophe in a small conference room, his normally composed face tight with concern.

"Elena," he said, rising when she entered. "Thank you for coming quickly."

"What's happened?" she asked, her mind immediately going to Sophia.

"It's about your sister," he confirmed, gesturing for her to sit. "And Viktor Lazarov."

Elena felt the blood drain from her face. "What about them?"

Christophe slid a tablet across the table. On it was an email from the sports ministry of her home country. "They're demanding we terminate your contract immediately. They claim you're under investigation for research fraud."

"That's absurd," Elena said, though her voice shook. "Viktor stole my work, not the other way around."

"I know," Christophe said quietly.

Elena's head snapped up. "You know?"

"I did some digging after you mentioned his name last month. The timeline didn't add up." His eyes met hers. "But there's more. They're using your sister as leverage. If you don't resign and return home to face these charges, they're threatening to arrest Sophia for espionage."

The room seemed to tilt. "Espionage? That's—"

"A fabrication, obviously," Christophe finished. "But a convenient one for them. They're claiming she's been passing university research to foreign entities."

Elena gripped the edge of the table. "This is Viktor's doing. He must have connections with the new regime."

"It appears so," Christophe agreed. "The tournament director received a call from Viktor this morning, offering to 'smooth things over' if you leave quietly."

"And if I don't?"

"Then they'll arrest Sophia and use her in a show trial about Western corruption of their academic institutions." Christophe's voice was gentle but firm. "You'd be the primary example."

Elena closed her eyes, feeling trapped. If she resigned and returned home, she'd likely be imprisoned on false charges. If she stayed and fought, Sophia would pay the price.

"There has to be another way," she whispered.

Christophe hesitated. "There might be. But it would require you to trust me completely."

The rain had intensified into a full-blown storm by the time Elena met Margot at the media center. The photographer was reviewing shots from the morning matches, but set her camera down when she saw Elena's face.

"What's happened?" she asked, leading Elena to a quiet corner.

Elena explained the situation in hushed tones, watching Margot's expression shift from shock to determination.

"So Christophe has a plan?" Margot asked.

"A risky one," Elena confirmed. "He thinks we can expose Viktor and the corruption simultaneously, but it would mean using me as bait."

"And Sophia?"

"That's where you come in," Elena said. "Christophe has arranged for an emergency visa, but someone needs to get the documents to her. Someone who won't raise suspicions."

Understanding dawned on Margot's face. "A photographer on assignment."

"You'd need to leave tonight," Elena said. "I know it's asking a lot—"

"I'll do it," Margot interrupted. "You know I will."

Elena felt tears threaten. "It's dangerous."

"Life is dangerous, chérie. Especially for those who stand by and do nothing." Margot squeezed her hand. "But what about you and Viktor? What's the plan?"

"I'm going to give him exactly what he wants," Elena said grimly. "A public confession."

The press conference was hastily arranged for the following morning. The storm had passed, leaving the courts drenched but the sky clear. Tournament officials announced that Dr. Elena Kovacs would be addressing "concerns about testing protocols" at 10 AM.

Elena stood backstage, her heart hammering. Christophe had positioned security personnel strategically throughout the room. Viktor would be there—he'd made sure of it, sending him a cryptic message suggesting she was ready to "clear the air" about their past.

"Are you ready?" Christophe asked quietly, standing close enough that she could smell his subtle cologne.

"No," she admitted. "But Margot texted an hour ago. She's with Sophia. They're waiting for their flight."

Relief flickered across his face. "Good. Remember, you just need to keep Viktor talking until we receive confirmation they're safely out of the country."

Elena nodded, then impulsively reached for his hand. "Thank you. For believing me."

His fingers tightened around hers. "Always."

The press conference began with the tournament director introducing Elena. Cameras flashed as she approached the podium, her professional mask firmly in place. She spotted Viktor in the third row, a smug smile playing at his lips.

"Thank you all for coming," she began. "I've called this press conference to address some serious allegations regarding my professional conduct."

She paused, making direct eye contact with Viktor.

"For those who don't know, before joining the anti-doping team here at Roland-Garros, I was a research chemist at the University of Eastern Sciences. My work focused on detecting synthetic performance enhancers that mimic natural hormones."

Viktor shifted in his seat, his smile faltering slightly.

"Five years ago, a groundbreaking paper was published on this very subject—a paper that revolutionized testing protocols in professional sports." Elena took a deep breath. "That paper was published under the name of Professor Viktor Lazarov."

Murmurs rippled through the assembled journalists.

"Professor Lazarov is here today," Elena continued, gesturing toward him. "Perhaps he'd like to join me and explain how he managed to produce such innovative research just days after gaining access to my private laboratory files?"

The room erupted in questions as Viktor's face darkened. He rose, straightening his expensive suit.

"Dr. Kovacs is clearly suffering from delusions," he said smoothly. "Her government is investigating her for academic fraud, not me."

"Yes, let's talk about that investigation," Elena replied, her voice steady despite her racing heart. "A convenient investigation launched by officials who receive generous 'consulting fees' from sports organizations you advise."

Viktor's eyes narrowed. "You're making serious accusations without proof."

"Am I?" Elena nodded to Christophe, who activated the large screen behind her.

On it appeared a series of emails—emails between Viktor and government officials, discussing how to "handle the Kovacs problem" and mentioning payments for their cooperation.

"Where did you get those?" Viktor demanded, his composure cracking.

"It seems you should change your email password more often," Elena said. "Especially when using public Wi-Fi at international tennis tournaments."

The press conference dissolved into chaos as security personnel moved toward Viktor. Elena's phone vibrated in her pocket—a message from Margot: *Wheels up. We're safe.*

She closed her eyes briefly, relief washing over her. When she opened them, Christophe was at her side, a hand at the small of her back as he guided her away from the podium.

"It's over," he murmured. "The French authorities are very interested in sports corruption. Viktor won't be bothering you again."

"And my sister?"

"The embassy has confirmed they'll grant her asylum. She'll be here by tomorrow."

Elena felt the weight of years lifting from her shoulders. "I don't know how to thank you."

Christophe's eyes softened. "Have dinner with me tonight. No talk of work or corruption or the past. Just us."

For the first time in years, Elena felt the luxury of possibility unfurling before her. The time for justice had come, and with it, the time for healing—and perhaps something more.

"I'd like that," she said, smiling up at him as they stepped into the sunlight of a new day.
