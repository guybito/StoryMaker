## Summary Report
"Shadows at the Lighthouse" is a well-crafted literary work that successfully blends artistic themes with elements of mystery and romance. The dual protagonists are clearly defined with distinct personalities, goals, and arcs that develop meaningfully throughout the narrative. The story's central conflicts around artistic integrity, intellectual theft, and personal relationships are compelling and escalate effectively toward a satisfying resolution. The prose is polished and technically sound, with strong descriptive elements that bring the lighthouse setting and artistic processes to life.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Physical Descriptions**: Enhance physical descriptions of the main characters to make them more visually distinctive. Currently, we know more about their artistic approaches than their physical presence, which would help readers visualize them more vividly.

* **Backstory Integration**: While both protagonists have established backgrounds, these elements could be more organically woven into the narrative rather than presented as expository blocks, particularly Eliza's family history.

* **Technical Details**: Strengthen the explanation of how Victor maintained access to Marcus's cloud storage after being fired, as this is a crucial plot point that currently requires readers to make assumptions.

* **Emotional Depth**: Though the character arcs are well-developed, the emotional journey could be deepened, particularly in showing (rather than telling) how the protagonists' feelings for each other evolve from rivalry to respect to love.

* **Pacing**: Consider tightening some of the middle sections to maintain tension throughout, as there are moments where exposition slightly slows the narrative momentum.
