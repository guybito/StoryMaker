## Summary Report:
"Bitter Tides" is an exceptionally well-crafted revenge narrative that successfully transforms into a story of healing and justice. The protagonist's journey from vengeful obsession to a more balanced pursuit of justice is convincingly portrayed through strong character development and meaningful conflict. The story excels in creating a coherent narrative with clear stakes, believable character motivations, and thematic depth exploring the costs of revenge and the possibility of redemption. The prose is polished and effective, with strong technical execution throughout.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Setting Development**: While the shipboard and Sevastopol settings are established, more sensory details and atmospheric elements would enhance the reader's immersion in these locations. The physical environment could more actively contribute to the mood and tension of key scenes.

* **Natalia's Character**: Though effective as a supporting character, Natalia's motivations and background could be further developed to make her more three-dimensional rather than primarily serving as a plot device for Marcus's journey.

* **Warehouse Explosion Resolution**: The warehouse explosion that serves as the climactic event feels somewhat convenient in its timing and outcomes. A more clearly established cause-and-effect relationship would strengthen the logical progression of the plot.

* **Internal Conflict Externalization**: While Marcus's internal struggle is well-portrayed, finding more ways to externalize this conflict through action rather than reflection would strengthen the showing-versus-telling balance in some scenes.
