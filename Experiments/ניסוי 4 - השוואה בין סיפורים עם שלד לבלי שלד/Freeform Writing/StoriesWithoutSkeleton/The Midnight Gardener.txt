# *The Midnight Gardener*

The full moon cast an ethereal glow over the neighborhood, illuminating Mrs. Abernathy's garden with silvery light. From his bedroom window, ten-year-old Ethan Parker watched as the elderly woman slipped out of her back door, a curious metal box clutched in her gnarled hands. At 2:17 AM, this was the third consecutive night he'd observed this strange ritual.

Ethan had moved to Willow Creek just two weeks ago, and the transition hadn't been easy. His parents' divorce still felt raw, and being uprooted from his friends and familiar surroundings had left him feeling adrift. His mother worked late shifts at the hospital, leaving him alone with his thoughts more often than either of them would like.

Mrs. Abernathy was a mystery to the neighborhood. Rumors circulated among the local kids—she was a witch, a mad scientist, or perhaps something even more sinister. Her overgrown Victorian house stood in stark contrast to the manicured lawns of suburban Willow Creek, and her garden was a wild, untamed thing that seemed to have a life of its own.

Tonight, something about Mrs. Abernathy's secretive behavior ignited Ethan's curiosity beyond containment. He slipped on his sneakers, grabbed his flashlight, and crept downstairs. The house creaked as if warning him to return to bed, but Ethan pressed on, slipping out the back door and into the warm summer night.

Heart pounding, he crossed his backyard and approached the fence separating their properties. Mrs. Abernathy's garden was even more bizarre up close—plants Ethan had never seen before twisted toward the sky, some seeming to pulse gently in the moonlight. The sweet, heady scent of night-blooming flowers filled his nostrils.

He spotted Mrs. Abernathy kneeling by a patch of iridescent blue flowers, her silver hair gleaming. The metal box lay open beside her, and she was carefully placing something into the soil.

As Ethan leaned forward for a better view, his foot snapped a twig. The crack sounded like a gunshot in the quiet night.

Mrs. Abernathy's head whipped around, her eyes finding him immediately. "Well," she said, her voice surprisingly gentle, "I suppose you'd better come over here, young man, since you've come this far."

Ethan froze, contemplating flight, but curiosity won out. He squeezed through a gap in the fence and approached cautiously.

"I'm not going to eat you," Mrs. Abernathy chuckled, patting the ground beside her. "Sit. You must be Ethan Parker."

"How do you know my name?" Ethan asked, keeping a safe distance.

"Small neighborhood," she replied with a shrug. "Plus, I was friends with the family who lived in your house before. They mentioned a boy would be moving in."

Ethan glanced at the metal box. Inside were compartments filled with seeds, each labeled with strange symbols.

"What are you planting at night?" he asked.

Mrs. Abernathy's eyes twinkled. "Moonflowers. They only germinate properly when planted under a full moon." She gestured to the blue flowers. "These are morning glories' nocturnal cousins. They bloom at night and close by dawn."

"But why do it at 2 AM?"

"The moon is highest then. The soil remembers the moon's position, you see." She smiled at his skeptical expression. "Gardening is full of old wisdom that sounds like nonsense until you see the results."

Over the next hour, Mrs. Abernathy introduced Ethan to her night garden. There were plants that glowed faintly in the dark, flowers that only released their perfume after midnight, and vegetables that grew sweeter when harvested before dawn.

"My husband and I spent forty years collecting seeds from around the world," she explained, showing him a particularly unusual purple vine. "After he passed, the garden became my connection to him."

As they worked together, planting moonflower seeds in careful rows, Ethan found himself sharing about the divorce, his loneliness, and his trouble sleeping since the move.

"Gardens teach us about change," Mrs. Abernathy said thoughtfully. "Sometimes you have to be transplanted to grow properly. It's uncomfortable at first, but eventually, you put down new roots."

When the eastern sky began to lighten, Mrs. Abernathy packed up her tools. "You should get home before your mother wakes," she advised. "But you're welcome in my garden anytime. Perhaps tomorrow you could come by in the daylight? I have strawberries that need picking."

The following day, Ethan visited Mrs. Abernathy's garden and was astonished to find it transformed in sunlight—still wild and unusual, but vibrant with color and buzzing with bees. Mrs. Abernathy taught him how to identify edible plants and showed him how to carefully harvest the ruby-red strawberries.

Over the summer, the garden became Ethan's sanctuary. He helped Mrs. Abernathy with the weeding and watering, learning the names and properties of dozens of unusual plants. Sometimes they worked in comfortable silence; other times, Mrs. Abernathy shared stories of her travels with her husband or offered gentle wisdom about navigating life's changes.

His mother noticed the change in him—he was sleeping better, smiling more, and seemed to be putting down roots in their new home. When she finally met Mrs. Abernathy, the two women connected immediately over herbal remedies, as his mother's nursing background gave her an appreciation for the medicinal plants in the garden.

By summer's end, Ethan had his own small plot in Mrs. Abernathy's garden where he was growing moonflowers from seeds they had harvested together. On the night before school started, they conducted their midnight gardening ritual together, planting bulbs that would sleep through winter and emerge in spring.

"Gardens and people aren't so different," Mrs. Abernathy told him as they patted soil over the dormant bulbs. "We all need time to adapt when transplanted. We all need care and patience to bloom where we're planted."

Ethan looked up at the full moon and then back at his new friend. The mysterious old woman from next door had become his guide, helping him find his place in this new chapter of his life.

"Same time tomorrow night?" he asked with a grin.

Mrs. Abernathy's laugh was as warm as the summer air around them. "The moon and I will be waiting."
