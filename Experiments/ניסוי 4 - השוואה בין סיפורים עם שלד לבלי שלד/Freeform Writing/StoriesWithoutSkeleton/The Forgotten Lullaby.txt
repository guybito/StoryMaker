# *The Forgotten Lullaby*

The first snowfall of winter blanketed the quiet town of Millfield as Emma Parker stood at her mother's bedside in the hospice. At thirty-two, Emma had achieved everything she'd worked for—a successful career as a concert pianist, a beautiful apartment in Manhattan, and recognition in the classical music world. Yet as she watched her mother's labored breathing, none of that seemed to matter.

"She might not make it through the night," the nurse had whispered earlier, her eyes full of practiced compassion. "If there's anything you need to say..."

Emma nodded, but what could she possibly say now? Their relationship had been strained for years, fractured by Emma's departure from Millfield at eighteen and her infrequent visits home. Her mother, once a promising singer herself before sacrificing her dreams to raise Emma alone, had never fully understood her daughter's ambition.

As twilight deepened outside the window, Emma noticed her mother's old leather songbook on the nightstand. She picked it up, feeling its worn cover beneath her fingertips. Inside were handwritten sheets of music, songs her mother had composed but never published. Emma flipped through the yellowed pages until she came across a lullaby—one her mother had sung to her as a child.

"You remember that one?" Her mother's voice, barely audible, startled Emma.

"Mom, you're awake." Emma moved closer, taking her mother's frail hand. "Yes, I remember. You used to sing it every night."

Her mother's lips curved into a weak smile. "I wrote it the day you were born."

Emma stared at the notes on the page, suddenly realizing she'd never played her mother's compositions. In her pursuit of classical perfection, she'd dismissed these simple melodies as amateur work. The thought filled her with shame.

"Could you..." her mother whispered, "could you play something for me? One last time?"

Emma glanced around the sparse hospice room. There was no piano, of course. But in the corner sat an old acoustic guitar, probably left by a previous patient's family.

"I don't play guitar, Mom," Emma said apologetically.

"You have perfect pitch and twenty-five years of musical training," her mother replied with unexpected firmness. "You can figure it out."

Emma hesitated, then retrieved the guitar. It was dusty and slightly out of tune. As she adjusted the strings, memories flooded back—of her mother teaching her to read music, of impromptu singing sessions in their tiny kitchen, of the pride in her mother's eyes at Emma's first recital.

With trembling fingers, Emma began to play the lullaby. She stumbled at first, the unfamiliar instrument awkward in her classically trained hands. But gradually, she found the melody, simple yet hauntingly beautiful. And then, surprising herself, Emma began to sing the lyrics she hadn't uttered in two decades.

"Sleep, my little starlight, dream of skies so blue. Know that I am watching, always loving you..."

Her voice, untrained but pure, filled the small room. Her mother closed her eyes, tears streaming down her hollow cheeks. When Emma finished, the silence between them felt different—not empty, but full of unspoken understanding.

"I always wanted to hear you play my songs," her mother whispered. "I kept hoping you would."

"I'm sorry it took me so long," Emma replied, her own eyes wet. "These are beautiful, Mom. Why didn't you ever try to publish them?"

Her mother's gaze drifted to the window, where snowflakes danced in the darkness. "I chose you instead. And I never regretted it, not for a moment."

That night, as her mother slept, Emma photographed every page of the songbook with her phone. She played the lullaby again and again until her fingers were sore, recording each attempt. Around dawn, her mother's breathing changed, becoming shallow and irregular. Emma set down the guitar and held her hand.

"I'm going to play them all, Mom," she promised. "The world should hear your music."

Her mother squeezed her hand weakly, and an hour later, she was gone.

Three months passed. Emma canceled her spring tour, much to her manager's dismay, and rented a small cottage in Millfield. She spent her days transcribing her mother's songs, arranging them for piano and voice, occasionally collaborating with local musicians who had known her mother.

The work became a bridge between them—a conversation they should have had years ago. Through her mother's compositions, Emma discovered a woman she had never fully known: a romantic, a dreamer, someone who observed the world with both melancholy and wonder.

On a crisp April evening, Emma gave a concert in Millfield's community center. The audience was small—just locals who remembered her mother—but Emma had never felt more nervous. She sat at the piano, took a deep breath, and began to play "The Forgotten Lullaby," now arranged as a piano concerto that preserved the simple beauty of the original while adding complexity that showcased her mother's melodic genius.

When the final note faded, there was a moment of profound silence before the audience erupted in applause. Many were crying, including Emma.

"These songs were written by my mother, Catherine Parker," Emma announced, her voice steady despite her tears. "She never got to share them with the world, but tonight, through me, she finally has."

Later that year, Emma released an album titled "Catherine's Lullabies." Critics praised its emotional depth and authentic voice—qualities Emma's previous work, for all its technical brilliance, had sometimes lacked. The album earned her a different kind of recognition than she was used to, touching listeners who knew nothing of classical music but recognized the universal language of a mother's love.

Emma never moved back to Manhattan. She bought her childhood home in Millfield and converted the living room into a studio where she taught piano to local children. On her concert tours, she always included her mother's compositions, telling the story of the forgotten lullaby and the legacy that had almost been lost.

And sometimes, in the quiet moments before sleep, Emma would play that first lullaby to herself, hearing her mother's voice in every note—a conversation that would never end, a love that had always been there, waiting to be remembered.
