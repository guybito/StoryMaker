# *Whispers in the Attic*

The old Victorian house on Maple Street had always been a source of fascination for twelve-year-old Emma Clarke. With its weathered facade, ornate gables, and rumors of being haunted, it stood apart from the other homes in the neighborhood. When her family unexpectedly inherited the property from a distant great-aunt she'd never met, Emma's curiosity transformed into an opportunity for exploration.

"We're moving in next week," her mother announced over dinner one evening, carefully gauging Emma's reaction. "The renovation team says it's structurally sound, just needs some updating."

Emma's younger brother Tyler groaned. "But all my friends are here!"

"And there will be new friends there," their father countered, his tone suggesting the decision was final.

While Tyler sulked, Emma secretly thrilled at the prospect. The house had been in their family for generations, though a falling out between relatives had kept her branch of the family tree distant from its history. Now, it would be her home—her very own haunted house to explore.

Moving day arrived with chaotic efficiency. Movers trudged up and down the creaking staircase with furniture while Emma wandered the unfamiliar rooms, running her fingers along the intricate woodwork and peering into dusty corners. The house felt alive somehow, as if breathing quietly around her.

That night, tucked into her new bedroom with boxes still stacked along the walls, Emma heard it for the first time—a soft, melodic humming coming from somewhere above her ceiling. She sat up, heart racing. The attic. It had to be coming from the attic.

"Did you hear that?" she whispered to her stuffed rabbit, Hoppy, clutching him tighter. The humming continued for several minutes before fading away, leaving only the unfamiliar creaks of the old house settling.

The next morning over breakfast, Emma asked, "Is there an attic in this house?"

Her mother nodded while pouring cereal for Tyler. "Yes, but it's locked. Great-Aunt Violet apparently kept it off-limits. The renovation team said there's just old furniture and boxes up there."

"Can I see it?" Emma asked, trying to sound casual.

"Maybe once we're settled," her father replied, not looking up from his newspaper. "It's probably dusty and not safe yet."

For three nights, the humming continued, always after her parents had gone to bed. Sometimes it sounded like a lullaby, other times like a sad, longing melody Emma couldn't place. By the fourth night, her curiosity outweighed her caution.

Armed with a flashlight and her father's forgotten keyring she'd borrowed from the hook by the door, Emma crept through the silent house toward the narrow staircase at the end of the hallway. A small door with peeling paint stood at the top, locked with an old brass padlock.

It took trying several keys before one finally clicked into place. The door creaked open to reveal a spacious attic, moonlight streaming through a round window at the far end. Dust particles danced in her flashlight beam as she stepped inside.

The attic was a treasure trove of history—trunks, furniture draped in sheets, stacks of yellowed photographs, and most intriguingly, an antique phonograph in the corner. Emma approached it carefully, noticing a record still positioned on the turntable, as if someone had been playing it recently.

As she examined the phonograph, a gust of wind seemed to move through the room, though the window was closed. The temperature dropped noticeably, and Emma's flashlight flickered.

"Hello?" she whispered, her voice small in the vast space. "Is someone here?"

The humming began again, this time not above her but beside her. Emma froze, goosebumps rising on her arms as a faint blue glow materialized near the phonograph. It swirled and took shape—the translucent figure of a young woman in an old-fashioned dress, perhaps sixteen or seventeen, with sad eyes and long hair that seemed to float around her.

Emma gasped but didn't run. Something about the apparition didn't feel threatening.

"You can see me," the ghost said, her voice echoing slightly. "No one has seen me in so long."

"Who are you?" Emma managed to ask, her voice trembling.

"Eleanor. Eleanor Clarke. I lived here... before." The ghost gestured around the attic. "This was my special place."

"Clarke? That's my last name too!"

Eleanor smiled. "Family returns to family, it seems."

Over the next hour, Eleanor told Emma her story—how she had died young of illness in 1923, how she had loved music and spent hours in the attic playing records on her beloved phonograph. She explained how the family had fractured after her death, with her sister Violet (Emma's great-aunt) becoming bitter and reclusive, eventually shutting up the attic where too many memories lived.

"I've been trapped here," Eleanor explained. "Not just in the house, but in this attic. Violet locked away everything that reminded her of me, including my spirit."

"Is that why you hum at night?" Emma asked. "To get someone's attention?"

Eleanor nodded. "I've been waiting for someone who could help me move on."

"How can I help?" Emma asked, feeling a strange connection to this long-lost relative.

"My music box," Eleanor said, pointing to a trunk in the corner. "It contains something I need to find peace."

Together, they searched through the trunk until Emma found an ornate silver music box. Inside was a locket containing a photograph of two smiling girls—Eleanor and Violet—along with a folded note.

"My sister never read my last letter to her," Eleanor explained. "I wrote it when I knew I was dying, but she was too heartbroken to open it after I was gone."

Emma carefully unfolded the yellowed paper and read Eleanor's beautiful handwriting aloud—words of love, forgiveness, and a plea for Violet to live fully and happily after Eleanor was gone. The ghost's figure seemed to brighten as Emma read.

"She needed to know I wanted her to be happy," Eleanor whispered. "That's why I couldn't leave."

"I'll make sure our family knows," Emma promised. "I'll tell them your story."

Eleanor smiled, her form beginning to shimmer more brightly. "Thank you, Emma. Family should know its own history—the joy and the sorrow both."

As dawn broke through the attic window, Eleanor's form gradually faded, the humming melody growing softer until it disappeared completely. Emma felt a gentle breeze pass through her, carrying the scent of lilacs—Eleanor's final goodbye.

In the weeks that followed, Emma shared Eleanor's story with her parents, showing them the letter and the photographs she'd found. Together, they restored the attic into a family room, displaying Eleanor's phonograph and playing her records. The house no longer felt haunted but instead filled with history and connection.

And sometimes, when Emma sits alone in the attic at twilight, she swears she can still hear the faintest hint of humming—not sad or longing anymore, but peaceful, like a gentle reminder that family stories never truly end, they just find new voices to tell them.
