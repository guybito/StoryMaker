# *The Recycled Reflection*

Marina's heart skipped a beat as she noticed the brass-framed mirror leaning against the donation pile at the community recycling center. Sunlight caught its surface, sending a kaleidoscope of colors dancing across the asphalt. At thirty-two, she'd developed a knack for spotting potential treasures among other people's discards—it helped offset her modest teacher's salary and satisfied her creative spirit.

"Thinking of taking that old thing home?" asked Reggie, the center's supervisor, his weathered face crinkling with amusement. "Been here since yesterday. Nobody wants mirrors these days—too much superstition about secondhand ones."

Marina ran her fingers along the ornate frame, admiring the intricate floral patterns. "Their loss is my gain. It's gorgeous."

"Take it then. Save me the trouble of breaking it down," Reggie said with a shrug. "Just sign the salvage form."

Twenty minutes later, the mirror occupied her passenger seat as Marina drove home to her small apartment on the east side of the city. Teaching high school art didn't pay much, but it allowed her summers off to pursue her own creative projects—like restoring vintage furniture and decorative pieces she salvaged.

"You'll clean up beautifully," she murmured to the mirror, already envisioning it hanging in her bedroom after a careful restoration.

That evening, Marina propped the mirror against her living room wall and began cleaning decades of grime from its surface. As the glass emerged from beneath the dirt, she caught her reflection—but something seemed off. She leaned closer, noticing that her reflection moved a split second after she did, like an echo of her movements.

"Too many late nights," she muttered, blaming fatigue for her imagination.

The next morning, Marina woke feeling strangely energized. Usually groggy until her second cup of coffee, she bounded out of bed with unusual vigor. Standing before the mirror, she observed her reflection—same disheveled brown hair, same green eyes, same freckles scattered across her nose—but somehow she looked... better. More vibrant.

Throughout the day, Marina felt lighter, more confident. At the coffee shop, the barista who'd never noticed her before suddenly engaged her in conversation. In the art supply store, a stranger complimented her "artistic aura." Even her landlord, typically brusque, smiled warmly when they crossed paths.

That evening, Marina stood before the mirror again, studying her reflection. "What's happening?" she whispered. To her shock, her reflection smiled before she did.

"You're noticing," her reflection said.

Marina stumbled backward, knocking over a stack of books. "What the—?"

"Don't be afraid," her reflection continued, voice echoing slightly as though coming from inside a tunnel. "I'm you—just... more actualized."

"This isn't possible," Marina whispered, approaching the mirror cautiously.

"I'm what you could be if you stopped hiding your light," her reflection explained. "This mirror shows potential, not just appearances. Someone once enchanted it—I don't know how or why. But I've been waiting for someone receptive enough to notice."

Over the next several days, Marina had lengthy conversations with her reflection—who called herself Mari—about art, ambition, and the fear that had kept Marina playing small her entire life.

"You've been afraid to really put yourself out there since your exhibition was criticized in college," Mari observed one evening. "That professor who said your work lacked authenticity—you've let him live in your head for a decade."

Marina nodded reluctantly. "It's easier to help students realize their potential than to face rejection myself."

"What if you used summer break to create again? Really create—without holding back?"

The suggestion terrified and thrilled Marina equally. With Mari's encouragement, she pulled out canvases she'd stored away years ago and began painting again—bold, provocative pieces that expressed emotions she'd long suppressed.

When her neighbor Elijah, a gallery owner she'd barely spoken to despite living across the hall for three years, noticed her carrying supplies, he became intrigued. "I didn't know you were an artist," he said, his dark eyes warming with interest.

"There's a lot people don't know about me," Marina replied with newfound confidence.

As summer progressed, Marina transformed. She spoke up more, reached out to old art school connections, and even submitted pieces to a local exhibition. Meanwhile, she noticed something strange—as she became more confident, her reflection became less distinct from herself. Mari no longer spoke independently; the delay between Marina's movements and her reflection's disappeared.

The night before the exhibition opening, Marina stood before the mirror. "Are you still there?" she asked, but only her own reflection stared back, mimicking her movements precisely.

Understanding dawned. The mirror hadn't been magical in the conventional sense—it had simply reflected what was already within her, making her potential visible until she could see it herself.

The exhibition proved successful beyond Marina's wildest dreams. Two pieces sold, and a prominent gallery expressed interest in featuring her work. As she celebrated with Elijah, who'd become more than just a neighbor over the summer, Marina realized how profoundly she'd changed.

When she returned home that night, she stood before the mirror one last time. "Thank you," she whispered, though she knew now she was only speaking to herself.

The next day, Marina carefully wrapped the mirror and drove to the community center where she taught weekend art classes to underprivileged youth. She donated it anonymously, attaching a small note: "Look deeply—you are more than you think."

As she walked away, she caught sight of a young woman eyeing the mirror curiously. Marina smiled to herself, wondering what potential the mirror might reflect next.
