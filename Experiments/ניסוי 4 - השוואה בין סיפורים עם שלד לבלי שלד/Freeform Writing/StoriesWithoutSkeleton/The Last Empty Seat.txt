# *The Last Empty Seat*

The morning rush hour on the subway was Jake's personal hell. As the train screeched into the station, he eyed the crowd with dread. At thirty-five, his social anxiety had only worsened with age, making the daily commute a special kind of torture. The doors slid open with a hiss, releasing a wave of stale air and the murmur of conversations. Jake adjusted his backpack, took a deep breath, and stepped aboard.

The car was packed, as usual. Bodies pressed against each other, faces buried in phones, eyes avoiding contact. Jake spotted it then – the last empty seat. It sat like an oasis in a desert of standing commuters. Without hesitation, he moved toward it, weaving through the crowd with practiced precision.

Just as he approached, a woman in a red coat appeared from the other direction. They locked eyes for a brief moment, both clearly heading for the same destination. Jake felt his chest tighten. Confrontation was not his strong suit, but the thought of standing for forty minutes while battling his anxiety was worse. He quickened his pace.

They reached the seat simultaneously. The woman – mid-forties, sharp eyes, hair pulled back in a tight bun – gave him a once-over. "Excuse me," she said, her voice crisp and authoritative. "I believe I was here first."

Jake opened his mouth to protest but found the words stuck in his throat. Around them, several passengers glanced up from their phones, curious about the minor drama unfolding. His palms began to sweat.

"I..." he started, then stopped. The woman raised an eyebrow, waiting. In the past, Jake would have surrendered immediately, retreated into his shell, and spent the rest of the day replaying the moment and crafting better responses in his head.

But something was different today. Perhaps it was the memory of his therapist's words from yesterday's session: "Small victories, Jake. That's how change begins." Or maybe it was simply that he was tired of disappearing.

"Actually," he said, his voice steadier than he expected, "I think we arrived at the same time. Maybe we could share?"

The woman's expression shifted from surprise to amusement. "Share a single seat? That's your solution?"

A few chuckles rippled through the nearby passengers. Jake felt his face grow hot, but he maintained eye contact. "No, I meant we could take turns. Twenty minutes each. I get off at Central Square."

The woman studied him for a moment, then unexpectedly laughed. "That's the most ridiculous compromise I've ever heard." She gestured to the seat. "Take it. I'm getting off at the next stop anyway."

Relief flooded through Jake, but it was quickly replaced by something else – disappointment. The interaction was ending too soon. "I'm Jake," he blurted out.

She paused, clearly surprised by the introduction. "Margaret," she replied after a moment.

Jake sat down, feeling strangely victorious. "Thanks, Margaret."

"Don't mention it." She gripped the overhead rail. "Though I must say, your negotiation skills need work."

Jake found himself smiling. "I don't get much practice."

"That much is obvious," Margaret said, but there was no malice in her tone. "You know, there's a community debate club that meets at the library near Central Square. Tuesdays and Thursdays. Might help with that."

The train slowed as it approached the next station. Margaret adjusted her bag, preparing to exit. "Just a thought," she added.

Before Jake could respond, the doors opened, and Margaret stepped out with the departing crowd. Through the window, he caught a final glimpse of her red coat before it disappeared into the station.

Jake sat back, replaying the interaction in his mind. For once, the replay wasn't filled with regret or alternative scenarios. Instead, he found himself thinking about the community debate club. Tuesdays and Thursdays. Today was Tuesday.

As the train continued its journey, Jake pulled out his phone and made a note of the library near Central Square. Small victories, his therapist had said. Perhaps this was one of them – not just claiming the seat, but claiming a moment of connection in a city of strangers.

When the train arrived at Central Square, Jake stood up with newfound determination. The last empty seat had given him more than just a comfortable ride – it had given him a direction. And as he stepped onto the platform, he decided that tonight, instead of heading straight home to his empty apartment, he might just take a detour to the library.

After all, his negotiation skills really did need work.
