# *The Beacon in the Woods*

Amber Martinez stared at the text message from her brother, a cold feeling settling in her stomach. "Found something weird in Blackwood Forest. Going to check it out. Don't tell Mom." It had been three days since that message, and no one had heard from Ethan since.

The police had been dismissive. "Teenagers run away all the time," they'd said. "Give it a week." But Amber knew her brother wouldn't just disappear, especially not when he'd promised to help her prepare for her astronomy competition on Saturday. Despite being only fifteen to her seventeen years, Ethan had always been the reliable one.

Standing at the edge of Blackwood Forest, Amber tightened her backpack straps. The dense canopy ahead looked more ominous than she remembered from their childhood explorations. Back then, their father had led the way, teaching them about constellations visible through gaps in the trees. Before cancer took him three years ago.

"You shouldn't go alone," said Maya, her best friend who had insisted on accompanying her despite Amber's protests. "These woods stretch for miles."

"I know where he'd go," Amber replied, pulling out her phone to show Maya the last photo Ethan had sent – a distant light visible between trees. "He's been obsessed with this strange light for weeks. Says it only appears at night and doesn't match any known structure on the maps."

The two girls ventured into the forest, following the crude map Amber had pieced together from Ethan's research notes. As daylight faded, the woods grew eerily quiet – no birds, no rustling animals.

"Did you notice?" Maya whispered, drawing closer to Amber. "The forest sounds stopped about ten minutes ago."

Amber nodded, uneasiness creeping up her spine. She checked her compass and frowned. "This doesn't make sense. The needle keeps spinning."

A soft blue glow caught her attention between distant trees. "There," she pointed. "That must be what Ethan saw."

As they approached, the light resolved into what appeared to be a perfectly round clearing where a pillar of blue light rose from the ground to the sky. Around its perimeter stood seven stone markers covered in unfamiliar symbols.

"What is this place?" Maya breathed, her face illuminated by the strange glow.

Before Amber could respond, she spotted a familiar blue backpack at the base of one stone. "Ethan's been here!" She rushed forward, but Maya grabbed her arm.

"Wait! Something feels wrong. Look at the ground."

The clearing's floor was perfectly flat and made of what looked like glass or crystal, reflecting the starry sky above despite the tree canopy that should have blocked it.

Amber's scientific mind raced. "It's like a window to somewhere else," she murmured, kneeling to examine the surface. Her fingers traced a familiar pattern in the reflections. "These aren't our constellations. They're... wrong."

A notebook lay beside Ethan's backpack. Amber flipped through pages of calculations and sketches. The final entry sent chills through her: "The stones create a doorway when aligned with the Perseids meteor shower. I'm going through tonight. If I'm right, Dad might be on the other side."

"Ethan thinks Dad is alive?" Maya asked incredulously.

Amber's throat tightened. "The night Dad died, he was talking about a doorway in the forest, a connection between worlds. We thought it was the medication talking." She turned to the last page. "Ethan's notes say the doorway opens again during tonight's meteor shower – exactly twenty minutes from now."

As if on cue, the blue light intensified, and the stones began to hum with energy.

"We should go," Maya urged, backing away. "Get help."

But Amber stood transfixed, remembering her father's final words: "The stars don't just guide us, Amber. Sometimes they take us home." She'd dismissed it as delirium, but what if...?

"I have to find him," Amber said firmly, calculating rapidly. "If Ethan's theory is correct, the alignment only lasts eight minutes. If I don't go now, I'll have to wait another year."

"You can't seriously be considering this!" Maya exclaimed. "We don't know what's on the other side!"

"Ethan does," Amber replied, determination hardening her voice. She removed her backpack, extracting only essential items – flashlight, water, first aid kit, and her father's old star chart that she carried everywhere.

"If I'm not back by sunrise, give this to my mom," she said, handing Maya her phone. "The video explains everything."

"Amber, please—"

The blue light pulsed, and the humming intensified. Above them, the first streak of the meteor shower cut across the reflected sky.

Amber stepped onto the crystal surface, which rippled like water beneath her feet. The mathematics made sense now – the calculations in Ethan's notebook, the astronomical alignment, the symbols on the stones that resembled constellation patterns.

"Trust the stars," she whispered, her father's mantra giving her courage as she walked toward the pillar of light.

The world around her dissolved into brilliant blue. For a moment, she felt weightless, surrounded by countless points of light rushing past like stars during hyperspace travel in the sci-fi movies she loved.

Then her feet touched solid ground again. The blue glow faded, revealing a landscape similar to the forest she'd left – but different. The trees here had luminescent bark, and unfamiliar constellations dotted the night sky.

"Amber?" A familiar voice called from behind a tree. Ethan stepped into view, his face a mixture of shock and joy. "You figured it out!"

She rushed to embrace her brother, relief flooding through her. "You idiot! Do you know how worried everyone's been?"

"I'm sorry, but Amber, you won't believe—" Ethan began.

"Ethan, who's there?" Another voice called, deeper and achingly familiar.

Amber froze as a figure emerged from the trees. Older, with streaks of silver in his beard, but unmistakable.

"Dad?" she whispered, her scientific mind struggling to process what her heart already knew.

Her father looked exactly as she remembered, yet somehow more vibrant, his eyes reflecting starlight that shouldn't exist under a forest canopy. "My brilliant girl," he said, voice breaking. "You found your way."

As they embraced, Amber's tears flowed freely. There would be time for explanations – how her father had stumbled through a similar doorway three years ago, why he couldn't return, and what this strange parallel world connected to their own actually was.

For now, standing beneath impossible stars with her family made whole again, Amber understood that some mysteries weren't meant to be solved, only experienced. And sometimes, the most extraordinary discoveries came from simply following the light through the darkness.

Behind them, the crystal doorway pulsed once more before fading, leaving only the forest and the stars to witness their reunion.
