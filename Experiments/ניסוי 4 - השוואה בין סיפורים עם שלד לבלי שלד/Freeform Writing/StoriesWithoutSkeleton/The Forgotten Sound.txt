# *The Forgotten Sound*

Eliza Cole stood at the edge of the cliff, her weathered hands clutching a vintage record player. The salt-laden breeze whipped her silver-streaked hair as she gazed across the vast Pacific. At sixty-seven, her once-vibrant eyes had dimmed, but today they held a spark that had been absent for decades. She had come to fulfill a promise made forty years ago.

"Are you sure about this, Mom?" her daughter Maya asked, concern etching her features. "That record player was Dad's pride and joy."

Eliza nodded, her resolve unwavering. "It's time, sweetheart. Your father always said music should be free."

The journey to this moment began in 1985 when Eliza, then a spirited twenty-seven-year-old ethnomusicologist, had traveled to the remote island of Vanuatu to record indigenous music at risk of extinction. Armed with state-of-the-art recording equipment and boundless enthusiasm, she had ventured into villages where outsiders rarely set foot.

In the village of Tanoliu, she met Theo, a local musician with an exceptional ear and a smile that made her heart skip. Theo possessed an uncanny ability to replicate any sound he heard, a gift passed down through generations of oral storytellers. While Eliza recorded traditional songs, Theo taught her to listen beyond the notes, to hear the stories embedded in the rhythms.

"Music carries the soul of our ancestors," he'd told her, his calloused fingers dancing across a handcrafted bamboo instrument. "When a song dies, a piece of our history vanishes."

Their professional collaboration blossomed into love, and when Eliza's research concluded, Theo returned with her to California. They married, opened a world music shop, and dedicated themselves to preserving endangered musical traditions. Their record collection grew legendary among ethnomusicologists, featuring sounds from cultures that had since disappeared.

Then came the fire. One night in 1995, their shop erupted in flames, destroying decades of irreplaceable recordings. They salvaged only a single record player and one mysterious unmarked vinyl record. Theo never revealed what was recorded on it, only that it contained "the most important sound of all" and extracted a promise from Eliza to play it at the right moment.

Six months later, Theo died suddenly of a heart attack, taking the secret of the record to his grave.

For years, Eliza couldn't bring herself to play the vinyl. The record player sat in her bedroom, gathering dust, a painful reminder of lost love and lost sounds. Until last week, when a letter arrived from Vanuatu informing her that the last elder who knew the traditional songs of Tanoliu had passed away. The music Theo had cherished was now truly extinct.

"Mom?" Maya's voice pulled Eliza back to the present. "The sun's setting."

Eliza carefully placed the record player on a flat rock and withdrew the unmarked vinyl from its sleeve. Her hands trembled as she positioned it on the turntable and lowered the needle.

For a moment, there was only crackling static. Then, a voice emerged—Theo's voice, younger and vibrant, singing in his native tongue. The melody was hauntingly beautiful, rising and falling like the waves below. As the song progressed, Eliza recognized it as a love ballad traditionally sung at weddings in Tanoliu, but with subtle variations that made it uniquely theirs.

The final notes faded, replaced by Theo's speaking voice: "Eliza, my love. If you're listening to this, the songs of my people may be forgotten by the world. But they will never truly die as long as the waves carry their rhythms and the wind remembers their melodies. Release this record to the sea when you're ready to let go, not of me or the music, but of the grief of losing them. Remember, the most important sound isn't on this vinyl—it's the beating of your heart, carrying our love story forward."

Tears streamed down Eliza's face as she understood at last. Theo had known she would cling to the physical remnants of their work, allowing grief to consume her. The record wasn't meant to preserve a sound; it was meant to liberate her from the weight of preservation.

With newfound clarity, Eliza lifted the record player and, with one fluid motion, cast it into the ocean below. The vintage machine splashed into the waves, disappearing beneath the surface as the setting sun painted the water in shades of gold and crimson.

"Goodbye, my love," she whispered.

Maya wrapped an arm around her mother's shoulders. "What was on the record?"

Eliza smiled, a genuine smile that reached her eyes for the first time in years. "The sound of letting go." She took a deep breath, feeling lighter than she had in decades. "Come on, I think it's time I taught you those songs. They shouldn't live in recordings—they should live in us."

As they walked away from the cliff, Eliza began to hum a melody that had been silent for too long. The wind carried it out to sea, where perhaps, just perhaps, it mingled with the eternal rhythms of the waves and found its way back to Theo.
