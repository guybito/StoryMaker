# *The Weight of Secrets*

The sharp ring of the telephone shattered the Sunday morning quiet in Dr. Elena Mercer's apartment. Squinting at her bedside clock—7:13 AM—she reached for the phone with a groan. Few people had this number, and fewer still would call at this hour.

"Dr. Mercer speaking," she answered, her voice still thick with sleep.

"Elena, it's Richard." The hospital administrator's tone made her sit upright immediately. "We need you to come in. There's been an incident with Patient 217."

Elena's stomach dropped. Patient 217—James Harlow—was her most challenging case, a man whose dissociative identity disorder manifested in five distinct personalities, each unaware of the others. After eighteen months of intensive therapy, she'd finally begun making breakthrough progress.

"What happened?" she asked, already swinging her legs over the bed.

"He attempted suicide at 4 AM. He's stable, but he's asking for you specifically. Says he needs to tell you something urgent."

Thirty minutes later, Elena strode through the psychiatric ward's security doors, her mind racing. James had shown no suicidal ideation in their last session. Something significant must have triggered this.

Outside his room, Nurse Garcia intercepted her. "Dr. Mercer, he's been alternating between personalities since admission. The dominant one now is Thomas—the protector."

Elena nodded. Thomas was the most rational of James's personalities, the one who often emerged in crisis situations.

"Has he said anything about why he did this?"

Garcia lowered her voice. "Only that 'they found us.' He keeps repeating that he should have told you sooner."

A chill ran down Elena's spine. In eighteen months of therapy, James had never mentioned being pursued by anyone.

Inside the room, James sat upright in bed, restraints on his wrists, a bandage wrapped around his neck. His eyes—usually warm brown—appeared almost black with fear.

"Thomas?" Elena approached cautiously.

His posture shifted subtly. "Dr. Mercer. I told them not to call you, that it would put you in danger too."

"What danger, Thomas? What's happening?"

He leaned forward, voice barely above a whisper. "The others don't know. I've kept it from them, even from James. But they've found us, and now I have no choice."

Elena pulled a chair close to the bed. "Who has found you?"

"The people I worked for. Before James's breakdown." Thomas's eyes darted to the door. "I was a data analyst for a private military contractor. Three years ago, I discovered evidence of illegal weapons sales to terrorist organizations. I compiled the evidence, planning to become a whistleblower."

Elena struggled to maintain her professional composure. This was entirely new information—nothing in James's history suggested military contracting work.

"Thomas, James's employment records show he was a high school English teacher before his hospitalization."

"James was. I wasn't." His eyes locked onto hers with frightening intensity. "You still don't understand. I'm not just a personality fragment, Dr. Mercer. I'm real. We all are."

Elena had heard this before—alters often believed themselves to be separate, complete individuals. It was part of the disorder.

"Before I could expose them, they tried to kill me. The trauma of the attempt is what fractured us. Created James as the host personality, who remembers nothing of my life."

"And now you believe these people have found you again?" Elena kept her voice neutral, clinical.

Thomas nodded grimly. "Two days ago, I spotted one of their operatives in the hospital visitors' area. Last night, someone accessed our room. I tried to end things before they could take us and extract the information."

Elena made a mental note to review the ward's security footage. If someone unauthorized had entered James's room, it was a serious breach regardless of the reality of Thomas's claims.

"The evidence is still out there," Thomas continued. "I encrypted it and hid it before everything happened. You're the only one I trust now."

"Thomas, I—"

"Please." The desperation in his voice was palpable. "Check my background. Look into Meridian Strategic Solutions, 2022. You'll find I existed."

Elena promised she would investigate, though she suspected this was an elaborate delusion—perhaps triggered by a real security breach in the ward.

Later that evening, curiosity drove her to search for Meridian Strategic Solutions. To her shock, the company was real—a private military contractor with government contracts. Further digging revealed they had indeed been investigated for illegal arms sales three years ago, though the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.

What she couldn't find was any connection to James Harlow or anyone resembling Thomas's description. Just as she was about to close her laptop, an encrypted email arrived from an anonymous sender.

"The evidence is in safe deposit box #742, First National Bank, downtown branch. Key is taped under the third bench in Roosevelt Park. Trust no one at the hospital. —T"

Elena stared at the screen, her professional certainty crumbling. Either this was an extraordinarily complex delusion spanning multiple systems and individuals, or...

The thought was too disturbing to complete.

Two days later, after much internal debate, Elena found herself at Roosevelt Park. The key was exactly where the email had said it would be. The safe deposit box contained a flash drive and documents detailing weapons shipments to known terrorist cells, all bearing Meridian's corporate markings.

When she returned to the hospital that afternoon, she found James's room empty, his restraints lying on the bed.

"He was transferred this morning," the floor nurse informed her. "Department of Defense request. National security matter."

"Who authorized this?" Elena demanded, her heart racing.

"Dr. Richards signed off on it." The name meant nothing to her—there was no Dr. Richards on staff.

That night, Elena's apartment was broken into. Nothing was taken, but everything was searched. The message was clear.

Three days later, a new patient was admitted to the ward. His intake forms listed dissociative identity disorder as his preliminary diagnosis. When Elena entered his room for their first session, she found herself looking at a stranger whose eyes held a hauntingly familiar expression.

"Dr. Mercer," he said in a voice she'd never heard before but somehow recognized. "Thomas sent me. We don't have much time."

Elena closed the door behind her, realizing that everything she understood about identity, consciousness, and her own profession was about to change forever. The weight of this new reality settled on her shoulders as she took her seat, prepared to hear a story that would shatter the boundaries between delusion and truth.

"Tell me everything," she said.
