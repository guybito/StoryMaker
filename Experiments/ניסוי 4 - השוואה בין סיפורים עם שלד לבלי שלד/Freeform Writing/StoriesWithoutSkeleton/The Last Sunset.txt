# *The Last Sunset*

Mila Chen stood at the edge of the rooftop, her silhouette sharp against the bleeding crimson sky. Thirty-seven floors below, Manhattan pulsed with life, oblivious to her torment. The wind whipped her dark hair across her face, but she made no move to brush it away. In her hand, she clutched a crumpled photograph—the last one taken of her brother, Kai, before the accident.

"You shouldn't be up here alone," a voice said behind her.

Mila didn't turn. "I'm not alone. I'm with my brother."

Dr. Alex Rivera approached cautiously, maintaining a respectful distance. As the hospital's grief counselor, he'd seen this before—the rooftop pilgrimages of those who couldn't let go. Mila had been coming here every evening for weeks, since her brother's life support had been terminated.

"It's almost sunset," he observed, glancing at his watch. "The last one."

"The last one," she echoed. Tomorrow, the hospital was closing its doors permanently—a victim of corporate healthcare consolidation. The building would be demolished next month to make way for luxury condominiums.

Alex had watched Mila's grief evolve over the past three months. As Kai's attending physician, he'd been the one to tell her that the motorcycle accident had left her brother with irreversible brain damage. He'd been the one to explain that the persistent vegetative state was permanent. And he'd been there when she'd finally signed the papers.

"I keep thinking I made the wrong choice," Mila said, her voice barely audible above the wind. "Maybe there was a chance. Maybe he would have woken up."

Alex moved closer, leaning against the railing beside her. "The human brain is remarkable, but there are limits to what it can recover from. You honored his wishes. That took courage."

Mila turned to him, her eyes red-rimmed but dry. "Did it? Or was I just tired of seeing him like that? Was I selfish?"

"Is that what you believe?"

She looked back at the city below. "I don't know what I believe anymore. Kai was all I had left after our parents died. He raised me, protected me." Her fingers tightened around the photograph. "Who protects me now?"

Alex had reviewed Kai's file extensively. Twenty-nine years old, he had become Mila's guardian when she was twelve after their parents were killed in a house fire. He'd put his own dreams on hold, working two jobs to support them both, ensuring Mila could attend college. The siblings had been inseparable—until three months ago when a distracted driver had changed everything.

"You know," Alex said carefully, "grief isn't just about what we've lost. It's also about what we're afraid to face without them."

Mila's expression hardened. "Save the therapy speak, Doctor. I'm not one of your patients."

"Aren't you? You've been coming to my group sessions for weeks."

"I come to listen. Not to talk."

"And yet here we are, talking."

A small, reluctant smile tugged at her lips. "Here we are."

The sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the rooftop. In the distance, the city lights began to flicker on, a constellation of human existence spreading before them.

"He loved sunsets," Mila said suddenly. "Every evening, no matter how busy he was, Kai would stop whatever he was doing and watch the sun go down. He said it reminded him that even the worst days end eventually."

Alex nodded. "Wise man."

"He was." Mila's voice cracked. "He had this stupid saying: 'The sun always rises, Mimi, but you gotta appreciate each sunset because you never know which one's your last.'" She laughed bitterly. "I never thought about what that really meant until now."

As the final rays of sunlight gilded the city, Mila opened her hand, revealing the photograph. It showed Kai standing on this very rooftop, arms spread wide, his face tilted toward the setting sun. He looked so alive, so vibrant—the complete opposite of the still form she'd sat beside for weeks in the ICU.

"I can't do this without him," she whispered.

Alex's heart ached for her. In his fifteen years as a grief counselor, he'd guided countless people through loss, but something about Mila's pain resonated differently. Perhaps it was her fierce independence, so at odds with her obvious vulnerability. Or perhaps it was simply that he understood what it meant to lose someone who defined your world.

"You can," he said quietly. "Not today, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually. And you won't be doing it alone."

She looked at him questioningly.

"The grief support group continues at the new medical center," he explained. "And I'll be there. If you want to keep coming. Just to listen."

The last sliver of sun disappeared below the horizon, plunging them into the blue hour—that liminal space between day and night. Mila took a deep breath and stepped back from the edge.

"I think," she said carefully, "that I might be ready to do more than listen."

Alex smiled. "That's a start."

As they turned to leave, Mila paused, looking back at the darkening sky. "Goodbye, Kai," she whispered, and gently released the photograph. It caught on the wind, hovering for a moment before dancing away into the gathering dusk.

They walked in silence to the elevator. When the doors opened, Mila hesitated.

"Coffee?" she asked suddenly. "There's a place around the corner. I could use the company tonight."

Alex considered the offer. Professional boundaries existed for a reason, but sometimes healing required human connection above all else. And tonight, as the hospital prepared for its final closure, perhaps old endings could make way for new beginnings.

"I'd like that," he said simply.

As they stepped into the elevator, Mila's phone chimed. She glanced at it and froze.

"What is it?" Alex asked.

She turned the screen toward him. It was a photo memory notification: "One year ago today." The image showed Mila and Kai at a beachside café, laughing as the sun set behind them. The caption read: "Last sunset of spring with my little sis. Here's to many more."

Tears welled in Mila's eyes, but for the first time, they weren't entirely of sorrow. There was something else there too—a glimmer of acceptance, perhaps even peace.

"The last sunset," she murmured.

Alex gently touched her shoulder. "But not the last sunrise."

As the elevator descended, carrying them back into the world of the living, Mila nodded. Tomorrow would come, as it always did. And perhaps, just perhaps, she would be ready to face it—one sunrise at a time.
