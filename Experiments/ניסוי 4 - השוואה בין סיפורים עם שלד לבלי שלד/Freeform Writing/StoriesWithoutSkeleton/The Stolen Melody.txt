# *The Stolen Melody*

Maya's fingers hovered over the piano keys, hesitating as the familiar anxiety crept up her spine. The recital hall was packed with industry professionals—this showcase at Juilliard could make or break her future. At twenty-three, she was older than most of her classmates, having taken a detour through pre-med before finally admitting that music was her true calling. Her parents had reluctantly supported the switch, but their expectations weighed heavily on her shoulders.

She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and began to play her original composition—the piece she had poured her heart into for months. The melody flowed from her fingertips, a haunting arrangement that told the story of her grandmother's escape from war-torn Sarajevo. As the final notes faded, the audience erupted in applause. For the first time in years, Maya felt truly seen.

Professor Lawrence, the head of the composition department, approached her afterward. "Remarkable work, Maya. I'd like to submit this to the Bernstein Competition. It could be your breakthrough." His praise was rare and precious, and Maya floated home on a cloud of possibility.

Three weeks later, Maya scrolled through her social media feed and froze. A video of rising star composer Julian Reed performing at Carnegie Hall showed him playing a piece that sounded eerily familiar. The melody was hers—the one she had shared with Professor Lawrence. The one that had come to her in dreams about her grandmother. But there it was, being performed by someone else, receiving a standing ovation.

"This can't be happening," she whispered, replaying the video with shaking hands. Julian Reed was Professor Lawrence's star pupil from last year, now making waves in the classical music world at just twenty-five. The professor had clearly shared her work with him, and Julian had stolen it.

Maya's roommate, Zoe, a vocal performance major with a flair for drama, urged immediate action. "You need to call him out publicly! This is theft!"

But Maya hesitated. Julian Reed was already established, with connections throughout the industry. She was still a student, unknown and vulnerable. And Professor Lawrence would certainly side with his golden boy. Without proof that the melody was hers first, it would be her word against theirs.

"I need to think," Maya said, retreating to the practice rooms where she spent most of her time.

That night, she couldn't sleep. The melody that had been her connection to her grandmother now felt tainted. She dug through her belongings until she found her grandmother's old journal, written in Bosnian with musical notations in the margins. The tune had been inspired by these fragments, combined with her own modern interpretation. This was her heritage, her story—and someone had stolen it.

The next morning, Maya received an email from Professor Lawrence: "Maya, I'd like to discuss your recent composition. Please come to my office at 2 PM." No mention of Julian Reed or the stolen melody. Just a casual request that made her stomach churn.

When she arrived, Professor Lawrence was reviewing sheet music, his reading glasses perched on his nose. "Ah, Maya. Thank you for coming. I wanted to talk about your piece."

"The one Julian Reed performed at Carnegie Hall?" Maya asked, her voice steadier than she expected.

Lawrence's expression flickered with surprise before settling into careful neutrality. "I noticed the similarities. That's what I wanted to discuss."

"Similarities?" Maya's hands clenched into fists. "It's my composition. The one I shared with you. The one you said you wanted to submit to the Bernstein Competition."

"These things happen in music," Lawrence said dismissively. "Parallel thinking. Julian's been working on his piece for months."

"So have I," Maya countered, pulling out her grandmother's journal and her own notebooks. "And I can prove it."

Lawrence leaned back in his chair, studying her with new interest. "You understand that Julian is already established. This could damage his reputation."

"And stealing my work damages mine before it even begins," Maya replied, her resolve strengthening. "I'm not looking to ruin anyone. I just want recognition for my work."

Lawrence sighed heavily. "I'll speak with Julian. Perhaps we can find a compromise."

But Maya knew a compromise would mean her accepting less than she deserved. As she left the office, she ran into Eliza Chen, the department's administrative assistant who had always been kind to her.

"I couldn't help overhearing," Eliza said quietly. "I've seen this happen before. Lawrence takes promising work from students and passes it to his favorites." She hesitated. "I have emails. Recordings of previous meetings. If you decide to fight this, I'll help."

Maya spent the night debating her options. She could accept defeat, create something new, and move on. She could confront Julian directly. Or she could fight—not just for herself, but for others who might have been silenced.

By morning, she had made her decision. With Eliza's evidence and her own documentation, Maya approached the dean of students rather than taking the issue public. The investigation was quiet but thorough. Julian initially denied everything, but when faced with the evidence, he admitted that Lawrence had provided him with "inspiration" from promising students, including Maya's piece.

The aftermath was both less and more than Maya had expected. Lawrence was placed on administrative leave pending a full investigation. Julian issued a public apology and credited Maya as the true composer. Her melody was recognized as her own.

The Bernstein Competition came and went without her entry, but something more important happened. Maya found her voice—not just in music, but in standing up for herself. Her grandmother had fled a war to give her family a future, and Maya wouldn't dishonor that courage by backing down from her own battles.

Six months later, Maya sat at the piano in a smaller recital hall. The audience wasn't filled with industry professionals, but with fellow students, family, and friends who had supported her through the controversy. Among them was her grandmother, now in her eighties, who had flown in from Boston for the occasion.

As Maya began to play a new composition—one that honored her heritage while looking forward—she felt a sense of peace. The melody was hers. The story was hers. And this time, no one could take it away.
