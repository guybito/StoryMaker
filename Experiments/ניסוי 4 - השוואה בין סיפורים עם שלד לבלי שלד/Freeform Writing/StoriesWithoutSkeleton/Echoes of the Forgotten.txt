# *Echoes of the Forgotten*

The amber glow of sunset spilled through the library windows, casting long shadows across dusty bookshelves as Eliza Morgan hunched over an ancient manuscript. At thirty-two, she had already established herself as one of the country's foremost linguistic anthropologists, specializing in dead languages. Her colleagues at Westlake University respected her brilliance but whispered about her obsession with work—a convenient shield against the emotional connections she'd avoided since her parents' sudden death a decade ago.

"Still here, Dr. Morgan?" The security guard's voice startled her. "It's almost nine. Even the janitors have gone home."

Eliza rubbed her tired eyes. "Just finishing up, Carl." She gestured toward the manuscript. "This Sumerian text might contain references to a civilization that predates anything in our current historical record."

Carl shook his head with a bemused smile. "If anyone can figure it out, it's you. Just don't forget about the real world out there."

After he left, Eliza returned to the text, tracing her finger along symbols that hadn't been uttered aloud for millennia. A particular sequence caught her eye—unfamiliar yet somehow resonant. Almost without thinking, she whispered the phonetic sounds.

The air in the library seemed to shift, growing heavy and electric. The manuscript began to glow with a soft blue light, pulsing in rhythm with Eliza's quickening heartbeat. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the phenomenon ceased, leaving only a lingering scent of ozone.

Eliza blinked, wondering if exhaustion had finally caught up with her. She packed her notes and headed for the exit, attributing the strange experience to fatigue and an overactive imagination.

Outside her apartment building, she noticed a man in a charcoal gray suit watching her. When their eyes met, he quickly turned away, disappearing around a corner. Something about his gaze left her unsettled—a recognition she couldn't place.

Sleep came fitfully that night, filled with dreams of ancient cities and voices speaking in languages she both did and didn't understand. She woke to sunlight streaming through her curtains and a strange symbol etched into her forearm—the same sequence she'd read aloud from the manuscript.

Her phone buzzed with a text from her department chair: "Need to see you immediately. Concerning the Sumerian text."

Professor Harrington was not alone when she arrived at his office. The man from the previous night sat beside him, his expression grave.

"Dr. Morgan, this is Agent Daniel Reeves with the Department of Historical Preservation," Harrington said, his voice unnaturally stiff.

"A department I've never heard of," Eliza replied, instinctively covering her marked forearm with her hand.

"We operate with discretion," Reeves said, his dark eyes studying her. "The manuscript you were working with yesterday has been removed from the university's collection for security reasons."

"Security reasons? It's a 4,000-year-old text about farming techniques and possibly an unknown civilization," Eliza protested.

"Is that what you believe it is?" Reeves leaned forward. "Dr. Morgan, what exactly happened in the library last night?"

The question sent a chill through her. "Nothing happened. I translated, I took notes, I went home."

"The security cameras show otherwise." Reeves slid a tablet across the desk. The footage showed Eliza reading the text, the strange glow, and then—impossibly—a figure materializing beside her for just a fraction of a second before the cameras cut out.

"That's not possible," Eliza whispered, though the mark on her arm seemed to burn with recognition.

"What you've done," Reeves said carefully, "is activate a beacon. Those symbols aren't just language—they're keys, Dr. Morgan. And you've just unlocked a door that's been sealed for thousands of years."

In the days that followed, Eliza learned the truth: throughout human history, certain texts contained encoded messages—bridges between our world and another dimension where beings of immense power had once been worshipped as gods. Her unique linguistic abilities had allowed her to activate the beacon, making her a target for forces both human and otherwise.

The Department of Historical Preservation had been monitoring these texts for centuries, ensuring they remained dormant. Now, with the beacon active, they needed Eliza's help to close the door before something came through.

"Why me?" she asked Reeves as they drove to a secure facility where the manuscript had been taken.

"The texts respond to specific genetic markers—rare combinations that appear maybe once in a generation," he explained. "Your parents weren't killed in an accident, Dr. Morgan. They were researchers for the Department who got too close to the truth."

The revelation shook Eliza to her core. Her entire academic career—her life's work—had been unconsciously leading her toward this moment, toward completing what her parents had started.

At the facility, surrounded by ancient texts and modern technology, Eliza worked feverishly to understand the full sequence that would reverse the beacon. Meanwhile, strange phenomena began occurring worldwide: unexplained lights in the sky, people speaking languages they'd never learned, archaeological sites suddenly revealing hidden chambers.

The mark on Eliza's arm grew more elaborate each day, spreading intricate patterns across her skin. She began experiencing flashes of memories that weren't her own—glimpses of a world where massive structures defied gravity and beings of light and shadow walked among humans.

As she delved deeper into the manuscript, Eliza realized that the "gods" weren't seeking to return—they were warning humanity about something else, something that existed in the spaces between dimensions. The beacon wasn't calling them; it was calling to this entity, using Eliza as its conduit.

"It's not a door," she told Reeves one night, her voice hoarse from exhaustion. "It's a prison seal. And I've started to unlock it."

The entity began appearing in her dreams—a shapeless darkness that spoke with her parents' voices, promising to reunite them if she completed the sequence. The temptation was overwhelming, but Eliza recognized the manipulation for what it was.

With time running out and the mark now covering half her body, Eliza made a discovery: the reversal sequence required not just the right words but the right intent. The original sealers had used their life force to power the prison—a sacrifice she would need to replicate.

"There has to be another way," Reeves argued, his professional detachment having given way to genuine concern for her over their weeks of work together.

"There isn't," Eliza replied softly. "This is what my parents were trying to prevent. This is why they were killed—to stop them from doing exactly what I have to do now."

On the night of a rare astronomical alignment, Eliza stood in a chamber beneath the facility, surrounded by the ancient text inscribed in a circle around her. The mark on her skin glowed with the same blue light she'd seen in the library, pulsing in rhythm with energies that swirled around the room.

As she began the reversal sequence, the entity fought back, flooding her mind with visions of her parents, of a life she could have if she just stopped. The pain was excruciating as the mark began to burn, drawing energy from her very essence.

"I am Eliza Morgan," she declared through gritted teeth, fighting for clarity. "Daughter of Rebecca and James Morgan. I am the seal, and I am the key."

With each word of the ancient language, the light from her skin transferred to the circle around her, strengthening the barriers between dimensions. She felt herself weakening, her consciousness beginning to fade as the ritual demanded its price.

In her final moments of awareness, Eliza felt a presence beside her—not the entity, but something warmer, familiar. Though she couldn't see them, she knew her parents were there, completing the circle, sharing the burden.

The world went white, then dark.

Eliza woke in a hospital bed three days later, weak but alive. The mark had vanished from her skin, leaving only a faint pattern like an old scar around her wrist.

"You shouldn't have survived that," Reeves said from the chair beside her bed. "No one has ever completed the seal and lived."

"I wasn't alone," Eliza replied simply.

In the months that followed, Eliza returned to the university with a cover story about a research sabbatical. But her work had changed—now focused on preserving and protecting the knowledge of the ancient world rather than just uncovering it. The Department provided resources and access, while she provided expertise and the unique connection she still maintained to the texts.

The door remained closed, the entity contained. But sometimes, in the quiet of her study, Eliza would trace the scar on her wrist and whisper words in a language older than civilization itself—not to open doors, but to remember that some bridges, once built, can never be fully dismantled.

And sometimes, just sometimes, she would feel an answering warmth—an echo from somewhere beyond, reminding her that she was never truly alone.
