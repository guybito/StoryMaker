## Overall Weighted Score: 3.6575

## Analysis Report
"Echoes in the Wilderness" is a well-crafted survival story that effectively blends physical danger with emotional growth. The protagonist's character arc from stubborn self-reliance to acknowledging his need for connection is convincingly developed. The story's greatest strengths lie in its clear conflict, strong character development, and thematic coherence around grief and isolation. The supernatural element, while somewhat unexpected, ultimately serves the central themes about lingering connections to those we've lost.

## Suggestions for Improvement

* **Foreshadow the supernatural element earlier** - The revelation about Martin potentially being a ghost comes without preparation. Adding subtle hints earlier (perhaps unusual aspects of his cabin or behavior that Alex doesn't initially register) would make this twist feel more integrated.

* **Deepen Elena's characterization** - While Elena functions well as Alex's emotional counterpoint, developing her character beyond her relationship to Alex would strengthen the story's emotional impact and make their reconciliation more meaningful.

* **Expand on Alex's grief journey** - The story mentions his parents' death as motivation for his isolation, but could explore more specifically how their loss affected him and what exact emotional barriers he needs to overcome.

* **Consider developing the climactic moment** - The transition from physical survival to emotional revelation could be strengthened by creating a more defined climactic moment where Alex fully confronts his pattern of avoidance.

* **Balance the pacing in the final act** - The story's conclusion after the supernatural revelation feels somewhat rushed compared to the carefully developed survival narrative. Allowing more space for Alex to process this experience would enhance the emotional resonance.
