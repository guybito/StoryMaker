## Overall Assessment

**Total Weighted Score: 3.4625

### Summary Report
"The Homecoming Promise" presents a well-crafted narrative of homecoming and reconciliation, with strong character development and thematic resonance. The protagonist's emotional journey is convincingly portrayed as she navigates conflicting loyalties between her urban career and hometown connections. The story effectively uses both internal and external conflicts to drive character growth, with particularly strong handling of universal themes related to finding one's place and reconsidering life priorities.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen secondary character development** - While Martha and Michael serve their narrative functions well, providing more insight into their lives beyond their relationships with Ellie would add dimension to the story and make the town feel more fully realized.

* **Strengthen the logistics of the festival relocation** - The relatively quick resolution of moving the festival to the lighthouse grounds could benefit from more details about the practical challenges involved, adding credibility to this plot point.

* **Expand on Ellie's Boston life** - More specific details about her work challenges and empty apartment would strengthen the contrast between her city life and hometown, making her eventual decision more impactful by showing more clearly what she's potentially giving up.

* **Clarify the timeline for Ellie's decision** - While the open-ended nature of her choice has emotional authenticity, providing more concrete details about how she plans to manage her career transition would add practical weight to her decision.
