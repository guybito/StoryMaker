## Total Weighted Score: 3.395

## Short Report
"The Glass Heart" is a well-crafted story with strong character development and thematic resonance. The protagonist's emotional journey from grief to authenticity is effectively portrayed through both internal struggle and external conflict. The central metaphor of the glass heart provides a unifying thread throughout the narrative, while supporting characters fulfill clear roles in facilitating the protagonist's transformation. The prose is polished and the structure is coherent, though some plot developments occur with convenient timing.

## Suggestions for Improvement

* **Character Development:** Provide more specific details about Alex's relationship with his mother before her death to strengthen the emotional impact of her memory and advice. This would deepen the reader's understanding of why her "glass heart" comment resonates so powerfully.

* **Pacing:** The two-month time jump near the end feels abrupt. Consider developing the transition period to show more of the challenges Alex faces in establishing his new venture, which would make his ultimate success more satisfying.

* **Plot Logistics:** Make Walter's connection to the coastal preservation board and Emma's expertise as a marine biologist feel less coincidental by establishing these elements earlier or showing how Alex actively sought out people with relevant knowledge.

* **Setting Detail:** Enhance the sense of place with more specific sensory details about the coastal environment to strengthen the reader's understanding of what's at stake in the development conflict and why this particular location matters to the characters.
