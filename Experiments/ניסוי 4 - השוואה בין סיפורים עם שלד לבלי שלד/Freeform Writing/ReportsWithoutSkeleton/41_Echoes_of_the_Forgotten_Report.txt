## Summary Report
"Echoes of the Forgotten" presents a compelling supernatural thriller with strong character foundations and an engaging central conflict. The story effectively balances academic mystery with cosmic horror elements, anchored by Eliza's personal connection to both the ancient texts and the interdimensional threat. While the prose is polished and the pacing effective, the narrative would benefit from deeper development of supporting characters and clearer explanation of some supernatural elements. The emotional coreâ€”Eliza's connection to her parents and her growth from isolation to sacrificeâ€”provides satisfying thematic resonance.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Supporting Character Development**: Expand the roles and dimensionality of characters like Professor Harrington and other Department members to create a richer supporting cast that can better reflect and challenge Eliza's journey.

* **Worldbuilding Clarity**: Provide more specific details about the Department of Historical Preservation's history, structure, and previous encounters with dimensional threats to strengthen the story's internal logic and make the organization feel more established.

* **Supernatural Mechanics**: Clarify the exact nature and capabilities of the interdimensional entity to increase tension and make the threat more concrete, while also explaining more precisely how the sealing ritual works and why Eliza was able to survive it.

* **Sensory Description**: Incorporate more consistent sensory details throughout to better ground the supernatural elements in physical reality and make scenes more immersive, particularly during key moments like the worldwide phenomena and the ritual chamber.

* **Resolution Expansion**: Develop the final section to more fully explore how Eliza's experience has changed her approach to her work and life, demonstrating her character transformation through specific actions rather than summary.
