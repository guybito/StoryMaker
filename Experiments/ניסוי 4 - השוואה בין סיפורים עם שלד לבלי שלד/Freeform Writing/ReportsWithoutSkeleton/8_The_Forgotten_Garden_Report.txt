## Report
"The Forgotten Garden" presents a well-written narrative about rediscovering roots and finding purpose through connection to place and community. The protagonist's journey from city executive to garden restorer is clearly developed, with strong technical writing and consistent characterization. However, the story would benefit from increased conflict and obstacles to create greater dramatic tension, as the protagonist's transformation occurs with relatively little resistance. The supporting characters, while functional, could be more fully developed to enrich the narrative world.

## Suggestions for Improvement

* **Increase the stakes and obstacles**: Create more significant consequences for Sarah's decision and introduce concrete challenges to her garden restoration efforts. This would build tension and make her ultimate success more satisfying.

* **Develop supporting characters more fully**: Give characters like Mia and the townspeople more distinctive personalities and roles in the story to create a richer community tapestry around Sarah.

* **Add more physical description and sensory detail**: While the garden receives good descriptive attention, characters and some settings could benefit from more vivid sensory details to bring them to life.

* **Create more complex internal conflict**: Deepen Sarah's psychological struggle between her city identity and emerging connection to Seabrook, perhaps by introducing specific career consequences or personal costs to her transformation.

* **Slow down the time transitions**: The shift from Sarah's arrival to her decision to stay and then to the one-year mark feels rushed. Developing these transitions would allow readers to experience her transformation more gradually and authentically.
