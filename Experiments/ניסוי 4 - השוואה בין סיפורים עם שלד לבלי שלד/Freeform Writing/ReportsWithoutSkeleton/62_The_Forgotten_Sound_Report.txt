## Overall Weighted Score: 3.4850

## Summary Report
"The Forgotten Sound" presents a emotionally resonant narrative about grief, cultural preservation, and the process of letting go. The story excels in character development, particularly in portraying Eliza's transformation from being trapped in grief to finding liberation. The thematic exploration of music as cultural memory is effectively integrated with the personal journey. The prose is clear and evocative, with strong imagery particularly in the climactic cliff scene. While the narrative is generally well-constructed, some aspects of timing and practicality could be strengthened to enhance believability.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen the supporting characters**: While Maya serves an important role, developing her character beyond being concerned about her mother would strengthen the intergenerational theme and provide more dimension to Eliza's story.

* **Elaborate on the timing**: Clarify why Eliza waited 40 years to fulfill her promise to Theo, as this extended timeframe raises questions about her motivation and could be better integrated into her psychological journey.

* **Add more sensory detail around the music**: Since music is central to the story, incorporate more specific descriptions of how the traditional songs sound and feel, helping readers better connect with what's being lost and preserved.

* **Balance the pacing**: The backstory occupies a significant portion of the narrative; consider redistributing some elements into the present-day scene to create a more balanced rhythm between past and present.

* **Strengthen the practical logic**: Address how a vinyl record remained playable after 40 years, particularly given its importance to the story's resolution, to maintain reader immersion in this crucial moment.
