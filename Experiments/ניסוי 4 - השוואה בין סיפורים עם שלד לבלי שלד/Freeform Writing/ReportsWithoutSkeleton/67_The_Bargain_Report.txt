## Summary Report
"The Bargain" presents a compelling ethical thriller with strong character development and escalating conflict. The protagonist's moral dilemma is effectively established and intensified through personal stakes, creating genuine tension. The narrative successfully balances technical elements with emotional resonance, though some aspects of the antagonist's power and the specific nature of the technology could be more fully developed. The open ending serves the story's themes while maintaining narrative satisfaction.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Technological specificity**: Provide more concrete details about how Project Helios works and its "unexpected results" to ground the ethical dilemma in more specific consequences rather than general concerns.

* **Antagonist's reach**: Better establish the mechanisms behind Elijah's influence over law enforcement to make his power more credible and threatening rather than seeming like a convenient plot device.

* **Integration of personal backstory**: More closely tie Alex's divorce history to his current ethical decisions to create a more cohesive character arc where past experiences directly inform present choices.

* **Resolution clarity**: While the open ending works thematically, providing slightly more direction about Alex's intended course of action would give readers more satisfaction while maintaining ambiguity about the outcome.
