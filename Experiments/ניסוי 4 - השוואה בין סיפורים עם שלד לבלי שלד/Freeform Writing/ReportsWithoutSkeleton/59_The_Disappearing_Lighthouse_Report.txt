## Overall Weighted Score: 3.2525

## Summary Report:
"The Disappearing Lighthouse" is a well-crafted supernatural tale that effectively blends maritime mystery with otherworldly elements. The story's strongest aspects are its clearly developed protagonist, compelling central conflict, and polished prose. The narrative successfully establishes James Connor as a solitary lighthouse keeper whose routine is disrupted by the mysterious disappearance of the Fresnel lens, leading to the revelation of his true purpose as a guardian between worlds. While the story excels in establishing atmosphere and character motivation, it could benefit from more detailed exploration of the supernatural elements and their consequences.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Develop the supernatural world more thoroughly**: The story introduces fascinating concepts about ships traveling between realms and boundaries between worlds, but doesn't fully explore what these other realms contain or what specific threats are crossing over. Adding more concrete details about what James sees "beyond" would strengthen the worldbuilding.

* **Strengthen James's character transformation**: While James does change from seeking isolation to finding purpose, the psychological process of accepting such an extraordinary new reality could be more developed. Showing more of his internal struggle or skepticism before acceptance would make his transformation more convincing.

* **Clarify the logistics of the lighthouse guardian role**: The mechanics of how the lens works as a barrier and what James's daily duties will now entail remain somewhat vague. More specific details about how he will balance normal lighthouse duties with supernatural guardianship would enhance the story's resolution.

* **Deepen supporting characters**: Characters like Thomas Wells and Lieutenant Rodriguez serve their narrative functions but could be more fully developed with distinctive traits and backgrounds to make them more memorable and three-dimensional.

* **Enhance the stakes and consequences**: While the story mentions "things crossing that shouldn't," it could more explicitly establish what would happen if James refused his role or what dangers these intrusions pose, which would heighten the dramatic tension.
