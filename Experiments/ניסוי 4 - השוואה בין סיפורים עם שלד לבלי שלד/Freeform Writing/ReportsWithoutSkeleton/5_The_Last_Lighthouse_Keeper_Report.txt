## Overall Weighted Score: 3.5600

## Report:
"The Last Lighthouse Keeper" is a well-crafted character study that effectively balances external drama with internal conflict. The story's greatest strengths lie in its compelling protagonist, clear central conflicts, and thematic exploration of purpose and obsolescence. The prose is clean and professional, with strong visual imagery particularly in the storm and rescue sequences. While the narrative could benefit from deeper exploration of supporting characters and tighter logical consistency in a few areas, it successfully delivers an emotionally resonant arc with a satisfying resolution.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Development**: Deepen Sophie's characterization beyond her role as catalyst for Martin's transformation. Her selective mutism after the trauma and subsequent recovery could be more fully explored to strengthen her impact on the story.

* **Physical Plausibility**: Consider addressing the physical demands of the rescue more realistically. Acknowledging Martin's struggle more explicitly would heighten tension and make his heroism more credible given his age and physical condition.

* **Supporting Character Arcs**: Develop Daniel's character beyond his role as a rescued father. His situation with his separated wife parallels Martin's isolation and could create a stronger thematic connection if more fully explored.

* **Sensory Detail**: While visual descriptions are strong, incorporating more sensory elements (the smell of salt air, the texture of weathered equipment, the specific sounds of the lighthouse mechanisms) would create an even more immersive experience.

* **Transition Pacing**: The shift from crisis (the rescue) to resolution (Martin's new purpose) happens somewhat abruptly. Expanding this transition would allow readers to more fully appreciate Martin's emotional journey.
