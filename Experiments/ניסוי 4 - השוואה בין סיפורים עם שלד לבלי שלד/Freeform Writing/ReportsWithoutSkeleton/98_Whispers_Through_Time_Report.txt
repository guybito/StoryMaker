## Report
"Whispers Through Time" is a well-crafted historical mystery that effectively blends research elements with personal connection. The story's greatest strengths lie in its character development, particularly Ellie's transformation from detached researcher to passionate advocate for a forgotten historical figure. The narrative maintains consistent pacing and thematic coherence, with the parallel between finding Sarah's voice and Ellie finding her own purpose creating a satisfying emotional resolution. While some plot elements rely on coincidence, these are generally justified by the story's exploration of connections that transcend time.

## Suggestions for Improvement

* **Increase narrative obstacles**: Add more significant challenges to Ellie's research process to heighten tension and create a stronger sense of achievement when discoveries are made. This would make the historical detective work more compelling and the resolution more satisfying.

* **Deepen Mark's character**: While functional as a contrast to Ellie's new path, Mark remains somewhat two-dimensional. Developing his perspective would create more emotional complexity in their breakup and better illustrate what Ellie is sacrificing for her mission.

* **Elaborate on the historical impact**: Provide more specific details about the battles Sarah influenced to strengthen the historical foundation and increase the stakes of the research. This would make Sarah's contributions feel more concrete and significant.

* **Clarify the nature of the connection**: The mechanism of Ellie's connection to Sarah (whether purely psychological or somewhat supernatural) could be more clearly defined to strengthen the internal logic of the story and make the dreams more meaningful.
