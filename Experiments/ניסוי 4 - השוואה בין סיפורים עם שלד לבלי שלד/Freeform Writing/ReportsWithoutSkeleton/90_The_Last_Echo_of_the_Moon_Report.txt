## Summary Report
"The Last Echo of the Moon" presents a compelling science fiction narrative with strong central conflict and well-crafted prose. The story effectively builds tension around a potentially world-changing discovery on the lunar surface and the attempts to suppress it. The characters are distinct and functional, though deeper psychological development would strengthen reader connection. The technical elements of the lunar setting and mission protocols create a believable near-future scenario, while leaving enough mystery about the discovery to maintain intrigue.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Depth**: Provide more backstory for Elena beyond her daughter's graduation. What in her past makes her willing to defy authority? How did she become a commander? These details would make her decision more meaningful and grounded in established character traits.

* **Supporting Character Development**: While Wei's behavior drives the plot, we learn little about his background or what makes this discovery so personally significant to him. Developing his character would add emotional weight to his actions.

* **Raise Earlier Stakes**: Introduce hints of Wei's discovery earlier in the narrative to establish the central conflict sooner, perhaps through Elena noticing his changed behavior before the crisis erupts.

* **Sensory Details**: Incorporate more physical sensations of living on the moonâ€”the unusual gravity, the silence, the temperature extremesâ€”to further immerse readers in this unique setting.

* **Resolution Elements**: While the open ending creates suspense, providing some indication of how Elena plans to get the evidence safely back to Earth would give readers more satisfaction while still maintaining mystery about the ultimate outcome.
