## Summary Report
"The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter" presents a compelling mystery with strong character motivation and a well-realized setting. The story effectively establishes Emma's quest to clear her father's name, building tension toward a satisfying resolution.

* **Strengthen the mystery elements:** Add more complexity to how Emma discovers and pieces together evidence, perhaps including false leads or setbacks, to make her investigative success feel more earned and suspenseful.
  
* **Enhance the setting as character:** Further utilize the lighthouse and surrounding environment to mirror Emma's emotional journey and create more atmospheric tension during key scenes.
  
* **Develop the environmental crime subplot:** Provide more specific details about the illegal dumping operation and its consequences to strengthen the story's thematic resonance and raise the stakes of Emma's investigation.
