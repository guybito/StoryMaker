## Summary Report
"The Forgotten Path" effectively portrays a couple's journey to reconnect with each other and their authentic selves through a wilderness hiking trip. The narrative successfully balances external challenges (getting lost, navigating difficult terrain) with internal conflicts (marital disconnection, identity crisis). The protagonist's character arc is well-developed, showing clear growth from a disconnected career-focused individual to someone who rediscovers what truly matters. The prose is clean and evocative, with strong technical execution and effective pacing.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Development**: Deepen Mark's characterization beyond his career ambitions to create a more three-dimensional supporting character who can more actively challenge Emma's growth.

* **Conflict Escalation**: Heighten the tension when they get lost by creating more significant obstacles or dangers that would force Emma to more dramatically confront her limitations outside the corporate world.

* **Emotional Specificity**: More explicitly articulate the specific fears and insecurities driving Emma's disconnection from her authentic self to create deeper emotional resonance.

* **Supporting Cast**: Consider introducing brief encounters with other hikers or memories of additional people from Emma's past to provide more diverse perspectives on her journey.

* **Resolution Pacing**: Develop Emma's realization about navigation and their path forward more gradually to avoid the somewhat convenient resolution of their being lost.
