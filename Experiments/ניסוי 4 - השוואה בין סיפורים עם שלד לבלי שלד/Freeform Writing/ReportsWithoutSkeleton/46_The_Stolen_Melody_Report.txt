## Summary Report
"The Stolen Melody" presents a compelling narrative about artistic integrity, power dynamics in academia, and personal heritage. The protagonist's journey from hesitation to self-advocacy is well-executed, with the conflict directly tied to her identity and background. The writing is technically proficient with clear, accessible prose that effectively conveys both the musical setting and emotional stakes. While some areas could benefit from deeper developmentâ€”particularly character dimensionality and certain plot mechanicsâ€”the story successfully delivers its thematic message about finding one's voice and standing up for oneself.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen character development:** Expand Maya's internal conflict and psychological state throughout her journey. Her anxiety is mentioned at the beginning but could be more consistently shown as she faces increasingly difficult situations.

* **Strengthen supporting characters:** Give Professor Lawrence and Julian Reed more dimension by exploring their motivations beyond professional ambition. What drives Lawrence to repeatedly steal from students? What does Julian truly feel when confronted?

* **Add more sensory details:** Enhance the musical setting with more specific sensory descriptions of how the melody sounds, feels, and affects listeners. This would strengthen the reader's understanding of why this particular composition matters so deeply.

* **Develop the resolution more gradually:** The administrative response and consequences feel somewhat rushed. Show more of the investigation process and the resistance Maya likely encountered, which would make her victory more satisfying.

* **Expand on Maya's heritage connection:** The grandmother's story from Sarajevo offers rich potential for deeper exploration. More specific details about how this history influenced the melody would strengthen the emotional core of the story.
