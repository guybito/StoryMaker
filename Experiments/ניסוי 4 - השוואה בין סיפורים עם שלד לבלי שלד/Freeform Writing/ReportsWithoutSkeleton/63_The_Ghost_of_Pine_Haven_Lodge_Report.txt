   - Score: 2.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.06

3. **Does the character have a clear goal or "desire"?**
   - Score: 3.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.09
   - Emma's initial goal of finishing her novel in solitude is clearly established, and later shifts to survival and exposing the truth about the lodge, though her motivations could be more deeply developed.

4. **Does the character have a clear inner weakness or vulnerability?**
   - Score: 2.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.06
   - Emma shows some vulnerability through her fear and initial skepticism, but lacks a defined internal weakness that influences her decisions or creates meaningful internal conflict.

   - Score: 2.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.06
   - Emma transitions from skeptic to believer in the supernatural, but this change feels circumstantial rather than representing genuine character growth or overcoming an internal flaw.

   - Score: 3.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.09
   - Elizabeth's ghost directly aids Emma's escape and provides crucial information, while the caretaker creates the central threat, though both could be more complexly developed.

7. **Do supporting characters fulfill archetypal roles?**
   - Score: 3.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.09
   - The caretaker functions effectively as the antagonist/monster and Elizabeth as the helpful spirit/messenger, though neither transcends their archetypal functions with unique characteristics.

8. **Are supporting characters diverse and distinct?**
   - Score: 2.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.06
   - With only two main supporting characters (Elizabeth and the caretaker), there is limited diversity, though they are sufficiently distinct from each other and from Emma.

9. **Is the number of characters appropriate?**
   - Score: 4.0
   - Weight: 0.10
   - Weighted Score: 0.12
   - The limited cast (Emma, Elizabeth's ghost, and the caretaker) suits the isolated setting and creates an effective atmosphere of claustrophobic tension.

10. **Are characters developed across three layers?**
    - Score: 2.0
    - Weight: 0.05
    - Weighted Score: 0.03
    - Physical descriptions exist but are minimal; psychological elements are present but not deeply explored; sociological contexts (like Emma's life outside the lodge) are barely touched upon.

    - Score: 2.0
    - Weight: 0.10
    - Weighted Score: 0.06

    - Score: 2.0
    - Weight: 0.15
    - Weighted Score: 0.045

## Overall Weighted Score: 3.0350

## Summary Report:
"The Ghost of Pine Haven Lodge" presents a competently crafted supernatural thriller with atmospheric setting, effective tension-building, and clear prose. The story establishes a compelling central conflict and creates genuine suspense through its isolated setting and supernatural threat. However, it would benefit from deeper character development, more complex internal conflicts, and greater logical consistency in its supernatural elements. The narrative prioritizes external threats over psychological depth, resulting in a story that succeeds as a conventional ghost story but misses opportunities for more distinctive character work.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen Emma's character development** by establishing specific personal challenges, fears, or flaws that connect meaningfully to the supernatural events, making her journey more psychologically significant than simply surviving an external threat.

* **Strengthen the logical foundations** of the supernatural elements by providing clearer rules and background for the caretaker's nature, Elizabeth's ghostly capabilities, and the history of the lodge, which would enhance credibility and reader investment.

* **Create more substantive internal conflict** for Emma beyond basic fear and skepticismâ€”perhaps through moral dilemmas, personal connections to the events, or meaningful choices that test her character rather than just her survival instincts.

* **Develop more distinctive physical and psychological descriptions** for the characters to make them more memorable and individualized beyond their functional roles in the plot.

* **Explore the thematic resonance** more deliberately by connecting Emma's experience as a writer with the uncovered stories of past victims, potentially examining deeper questions about narrative, memory, and bearing witness to tragedy.
