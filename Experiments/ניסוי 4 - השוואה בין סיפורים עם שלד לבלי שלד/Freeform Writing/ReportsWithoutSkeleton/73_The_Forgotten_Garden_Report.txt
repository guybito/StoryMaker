## Overall Assessment

**Total Weighted Score: 3.1400

**Report:**
"The Forgotten Garden" presents a well-crafted narrative about personal healing through uncovering family history. The story's strengths lie in its clear protagonist, thematic depth around healing and belonging, and the parallel between Maya's personal restoration and the garden's revival. The prose is clean and effective, with vivid descriptions of the setting. While the character development is strong for Maya, supporting characters could be more fully realized, and some plot elements would benefit from deeper exploration.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Deepen supporting characters** by providing more distinct personality traits and backgrounds for Henry and glimpses of Maya's grandmother's life beyond the scandal. This would create a richer social context for Maya's discoveries.

* **Increase narrative tension** by adding complications or obstacles to Maya's search for answers. The relatively smooth progression of discoveries could benefit from setbacks that raise the emotional stakes.

* **Expand Maya's physical characterization** to help readers visualize her more clearly. Currently, we know about her emotional state but have limited sense of her appearance or presence.

* **Clarify the relationship between Maya and her grandmother** to better explain why they weren't close and why the grandmother never mentioned her childhood home. This would add emotional depth to Maya's journey of discovery.

* **Develop the town and community context** more fully to show how social attitudes have changed (or haven't) since Elizabeth's time. This would strengthen the thematic exploration of judgment and forgiveness.
