## TOTAL WEIGHTED SCORE: 3.5975

## Summary Report
"The Forgotten Memory" is a well-crafted supernatural mystery that effectively explores themes of memory, loss, and family secrets. The story's greatest strengths lie in its clear characterization of Maya, the compelling central conflict driving the narrative, and polished prose. The supernatural elements are integrated thoughtfully into the emotional core of the story, creating a meaningful exploration of how we process trauma and connect with our past. While some aspects of the "memory science" could be more fully developed, the emotional truth of the narrative resonates effectively.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
* **Deepen the scientific framework**: The concept of "place memory" is intriguing but could benefit from more specific details about how it works, making the supernatural elements feel more grounded in a consistent system.
* **Increase emotional tension**: While Maya's discovery of her past is moving, her emotional reactions could be more visceral and detailed to heighten the impact of key revelations.
* **Develop supporting characters**: The mother's character could be enriched by exploring her motivations for maintaining the deception more deeply, creating more nuanced interpersonal dynamics.
* **Clarify the journal's mechanics**: The appearance of new writing in the journal is a powerful moment but could be better integrated into the established rules of how memory and place interact in this world.
* **Build more dramatic escalation**: The story could benefit from more pronounced obstacles or setbacks as Maya investigates, creating a stronger sense of rising action before the climactic memory recovery.
