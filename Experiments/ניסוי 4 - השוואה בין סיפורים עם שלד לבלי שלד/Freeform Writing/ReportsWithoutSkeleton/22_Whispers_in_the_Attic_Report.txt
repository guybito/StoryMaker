## Analysis Report
"Whispers in the Attic" presents a well-crafted ghost story that effectively balances supernatural elements with themes of family connection and reconciliation. The narrative features a clear protagonist whose curiosity drives the plot forward, while the ghost Eleanor provides both mystery and emotional depth. The story's strengths lie in its accessible prose, atmospheric setting, and heartfelt resolution. While character development could be deeper and some supernatural mechanics clearer, the story succeeds in creating an engaging, cohesive narrative appropriate for its intended audience.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen character development**: Provide more insight into Emma's inner life and personal struggles beyond curiosity to create stronger reader identification and raise emotional stakes. This would make her transformation more impactful.

* **Strengthen the family conflict**: Develop the historical family rift in more detail to create greater tension and make the resolution more satisfying. The falling out between relatives is mentioned but not explored in depth.

* **Clarify supernatural elements**: Explain more explicitly how Eleanor became trapped in the attic and why she couldn't communicate with others before Emma, which would strengthen the story's internal logic.

* **Increase obstacles**: Create more significant challenges for Emma to overcome before resolving Eleanor's situation, which would heighten tension and make the resolution more satisfying.

* **Expand sensory details**: Include more specific sensory descriptions of the house, attic, and characters to create a more immersive reading experience and strengthen the atmospheric elements.
