## Overall Weighted Score: 3.5975

## Summary Report
"The Price of Tomorrow" presents a compelling character-driven science fiction narrative with strong emotional stakes. The story effectively balances personal motivation with ethical questions about responsibility and consequences. The time travel premise is handled with internal consistency, and the protagonist's journey contains meaningful character development. While some supporting elements could be further developed, the core narrative successfully explores universal themes of grief, guilt, and the desire to change the past.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Expand on the bomber's motivation**: The line "You don't understand what you're preventing" suggests deeper implications that could enrich the story's complexity if explored further. This would strengthen the moral ambiguity and heighten the stakes of Ava's decision.

* **Provide more detail about the temporal mechanics**: While the time travel elements work well, explaining more specifically how the TEA detected the breach and why Ava returned to the exact moment she left would strengthen the story's internal logic.

* **Develop Lily's character beyond her function as motivation**: While Lily serves her narrative purpose, giving her more agency and dimension would increase the emotional impact of Ava's sacrifice and make their relationship more compelling.

* **Explore the ripple effects**: The story ends with questions about what consequences Ava's actions might have caused. Providing at least one specific example of an unexpected change would give more weight to the story's thematic conclusion about the price of altering time.
