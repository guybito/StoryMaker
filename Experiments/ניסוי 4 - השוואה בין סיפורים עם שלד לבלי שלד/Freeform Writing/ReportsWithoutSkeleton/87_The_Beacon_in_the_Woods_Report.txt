## Overall Assessment

**Total Weighted Score: 3.2375

**Summary Report:**
"The Beacon in the Woods" is a well-crafted supernatural tale that effectively blends family drama with science fiction elements. The story's greatest strengths lie in its clear protagonist, compelling central conflict, and exploration of universal themes of grief and family bonds. The prose is clean and accessible, creating an engaging reading experience. However, the story would benefit from addressing several logical questions about the portal mechanics and providing deeper characterization beyond the central relationships.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Develop the portal mechanics** more thoroughly to address questions about why the father couldn't return and how Ethan discovered its workings. This would strengthen the story's internal logic and prevent readers from being distracted by these unanswered questions.

* **Clarify the circumstances of the father's "death"** versus his disappearance through the portal. The current explanation that he "died of cancer" yet somehow went through a portal creates confusion that undermines the emotional impact of the reunion.

* **Provide more physical description of the characters** to help readers visualize them and create a stronger connection. Currently, we know very little about how any character looks beyond minimal details.

* **Integrate the astronomy competition element** more meaningfully into the plot rather than using it as a passing reference. This could strengthen the thematic connection between Amber's scientific interests and her supernatural experience.

* **Explore Maya's character and reaction** more fully, as her role diminishes once the portal is discovered. Her perspective as the skeptical outsider could provide valuable contrast to the family's acceptance of the supernatural.
