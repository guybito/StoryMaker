# *Breaking Free*

Yael Cohen had always been the dutiful daughter. At thirty-two, she had spent the last decade of her life caring for her widowed father, Jacob, whose mental health had deteriorated significantly after her mother's death. What most people in their small coastal town of Millhaven didn't know was that Jacob suffered from bipolar disorder with psychotic features—episodes that Yael had become adept at hiding from the outside world.

The Cohen family home, a weathered Victorian on Lighthouse Road, had once been filled with warmth and laughter. Now it felt like a prison, its walls absorbing the tension that hung perpetually in the air. The scent of her father's medicinal tea mingled with the lingering mustiness of closed windows. Yael's once vibrant artistic ambitions had been packed away, much like her mother's belongings, in boxes that gathered dust in the attic. Her paintbrushes lay untouched, bristles stiffened with age, a constant reminder of dreams deferred.

"Dad, have you taken your medication today?" Yael asked one morning, placing a cup of tea beside Jacob, who sat staring vacantly out the window at the fog rolling in from the harbor.

"I don't need those pills," Jacob muttered, pushing the cup away with trembling fingers. The ceramic scraped against the wooden table. "They're poisoning me. Your mother would never have allowed this."

Yael sighed, recognizing the early signs of another episode. She'd become an expert at reading these signals—the paranoia, the agitation, the refusal of medication. During these periods, Jacob would become a different person entirely: suspicious, sometimes cruel, and occasionally dangerous. Last month, he'd thrown all his medication down the garbage disposal, resulting in a three-day episode that left both of them exhausted.

Her father's condition was the terrible secret they kept from the world. In Millhaven, Jacob Cohen was respected as the former high school principal—stern but fair, a pillar of the community. No one knew about the nights Yael spent talking him down from paranoid delusions or cleaning up after destructive episodes, the broken picture frames and torn books that marked his worst moments.

"Mary called earlier," Yael said, referring to her mother's best friend who checked in regularly. "She wants to bring over some dinner tonight."

"Tell her no," Jacob snapped, his knuckles whitening as he gripped the armrest of his chair. "She's just coming to spy on me. They all are."

Yael's phone buzzed with a text from Ido Levine, the local bookstore owner she'd been seeing casually for the past few months. *Coffee later?* the message read. A small smile crossed her face before reality crashed back in. She couldn't leave her father alone today, not when he was like this.

*Can't today. Dad needs me. Rain check?* she replied, ignoring the familiar ache of disappointment that settled in her chest like a stone.

Ido was patient and kind, with warm brown eyes that crinkled when he laughed and hands that moved expressively when he talked about books he loved. Their connection had been immediate when they met at a community fundraiser, but Yael had kept him at arm's length, knowing her responsibilities at home made a serious relationship impossible.

"Who are you texting?" Jacob demanded, suddenly beside her. She hadn't heard him approach, his slippered feet silent on the hardwood floor. "Is it that man again? You know you can't leave me, Yael. I need you here."

"It's just work, Dad," she lied, pocketing her phone. "Nothing important."

The days blurred together in a monotonous cycle of caretaking, working remotely as a graphic designer between her father's episodes, and stealing brief moments for herself. The constant vigilance left dark circles under her eyes and a perpetual tension in her shoulders. Yael's only consistent outlet was her weekly coffee with her childhood friend Liam, who had returned to Millhaven after a divorce.

"You can't keep living like this," Liam told her during one of these meetings, the steam from his coffee curling between them like a question mark. "You're disappearing, Yael. When was the last time you painted anything?"

"I don't have time for painting," she replied automatically, though the truth was more complicated. Her creativity had withered under the weight of her responsibilities, like a plant deprived of sunlight.

"Your father has options. There are facilities—"

"We've been through this," Yael interrupted, her spoon clinking sharply against her cup. "He refuses to go, and I can't force him. He's not legally incompetent. The last time I brought it up, he didn't speak to me for days."

"Then let your sister help more. Hannah lives thirty minutes away, for God's sake."

Yael's older sister, Hannah—named after their grandmother in a family tradition—was another source of tension. While Yael had sacrificed her life to care for their father, Hannah visited sporadically, offering hollow promises of assistance that never materialized.

"Hannah has her own life," Yael said defensively, though resentment bubbled beneath her words. "Her job at the law firm keeps her busy."

"And you don't deserve your own life?" Liam challenged, his eyes holding hers until she looked away.

The breaking point came on a stormy Tuesday evening. Rain lashed against the windows as Yael hunched over her laptop at the kitchen table, racing to finish a deadline project. The harsh blue light of the screen illuminated her tired face as her fingers flew across the keyboard. That's when her father entered one of his worst episodes in years. He burst into the kitchen, eyes wild, accusing her of stealing his money, threw her laptop against the wall with a sickening crack, and locked himself in the bathroom, threatening self-harm.

After a terrifying hour of coaxing him out and calming him down, the smell of his sweat and fear filling the small bathroom, Yael called her sister in desperation.

"I can't come tonight," Hannah said, her voice tinged with irritation. The clink of glasses and murmur of conversation in the background made it clear she was out. "I have an important dinner with clients. Can't you handle it like you always do?"

"No, I can't!" Yael shouted, her composure finally cracking. Her free hand trembled as she gripped the counter for support. "I've been 'handling it' for ten years while you've been living your life. I need help, Hannah. Now."

"Don't be dramatic. Dad prefers you anyway," Hannah replied dismissively. "Besides, I'm paying most of the bills, aren't I? That's my contribution."

After hanging up, Yael sat on the kitchen floor and wept, the cold tile pressing against her legs as the weight of a decade's worth of sacrifice and resentment crashed down on her. When her phone rang again, she answered without checking, expecting her sister.

"Yael? Are you okay?" Ido's concerned voice came through instead. "I was driving by and saw all the lights on. It's pretty late."

The genuine worry in his voice broke something in her. "No," she admitted for the first time, her voice catching. "I'm not okay."

That night, after her father had finally fallen asleep, his breathing deep and regular thanks to the emergency medication she'd managed to get him to take, Yael made a decision. She called Mary, her mother's friend who had been a psychiatric nurse before retirement, and arranged for her to stay with Jacob the following day. Then she drove to Ido's apartment above his bookstore, the streets empty and slick with rain.

"I can't do this anymore," she told him, sitting on his worn leather couch, the material creaking softly beneath her. The apartment smelled of old books and fresh coffee. "I've been hiding my father's condition, sacrificing everything, and for what? To be treated like a servant by my sister? To watch my life pass by?"

Ido listened without interruption, his presence a steady anchor as she poured out years of frustration and pain.

"What do you want, Yael?" he asked simply when she finally fell silent, handing her a mug of tea that warmed her cold hands.

The question startled her. No one had asked what she wanted in so long.

"I want..." she began hesitantly, staring into the amber liquid, "I want to paint again. I want to wake up without dread. I want to feel the sun on my face without worrying about what crisis awaits me at home." She looked at him then, really looked at him. "I want a chance with you."

"Then take it," he said, reaching for her hand, his fingers intertwining with hers. "Not just with me—with your life. You deserve that chance."

The next morning, Yael called a family meeting. Her father was lucid, the medication having taken effect, and her sister arrived with obvious reluctance, her designer heels clicking impatiently on the hardwood floor.

"This isn't working," Yael announced, standing by the fireplace where family photos chronicled happier times. "Dad needs professional help that I can't provide, and I won't continue to be the only one making sacrifices."

"What are you saying?" Hannah demanded, arms crossed defensively. "You're abandoning him? Abandoning us?"

"No," Yael replied firmly, her voice stronger than it had been in years. "I'm saying we need to share responsibility equally, or we need to consider assisted living options. And I'm saying that I'm moving out, regardless."

Her father looked up, surprise and hurt in his eyes. The morning light through the window revealed how much he had aged. "You're leaving me?"

"I'm not leaving you, Dad," Yael said gently, kneeling beside his chair. "I'm just not living with you anymore. I'll still be part of your life, but I need my own life too. Dr. Brennan has been recommending this partial hospitalization program for months. It could really help you."

The conversation was difficult, filled with accusations from Hannah and pleas from her father, but Yael stood firm. By the end, they had reached a compromise: Hannah would spend three days a week at the house, they would hire a part-time caregiver with experience in psychiatric care, and Jacob would attend the outpatient program at Millhaven Memorial Hospital three days a week. They would begin researching suitable living facilities for when home care became insufficient.

Over the following months, Yael found a small apartment near the harbor. The salt air cleared her head as she walked along the shore each morning. She set up a painting studio in the spare bedroom, the smell of oils and turpentine a welcome return to her former self. She gradually increased her freelance design work, no longer interrupted by constant crises. Her relationship with Ido deepened as they explored the connection they'd both felt from the beginning.

Her father had difficult days, and Hannah occasionally reverted to her old patterns of neglect, but Yael no longer shouldered the burden alone. She learned to set boundaries, to ask for help, and most importantly, to prioritize her own well-being without drowning in guilt.

Six months after moving out, Yael held her first small art exhibition in Ido's bookstore. Her paintings—vibrant, emotional works that processed her years of caretaking—drew unexpected attention from a gallery owner in the neighboring city. The canvases captured both the darkness of confinement and the light of liberation, colors swirling together in a visual testimony to her journey.

As she stood beside Ido at the exhibition, watching her father engage lucidly with other attendees while Mary kept a watchful eye on him, Yael felt a sense of peace she hadn't experienced in years. Jacob, now stabilized on a new medication regimen from the program, even stood proudly before her centerpiece painting—a lighthouse beam cutting through storm clouds.

"Are you happy?" Ido asked, his arm around her waist, his voice soft against her ear.

Yael considered the question. Her life wasn't perfect—her father's condition remained challenging, and her relationship with Hannah was still strained—but for the first time in a decade, she was living on her own terms.

"Yes," she replied, realizing with surprise that it was true. "I am."

She had rescued her integrity from the entanglement of obligation and resentment. In breaking free from the tyranny of expectations—both her sister's and her own—Yael had finally found her way back to herself, brush in hand, painting her way toward a future bright with possibility.
