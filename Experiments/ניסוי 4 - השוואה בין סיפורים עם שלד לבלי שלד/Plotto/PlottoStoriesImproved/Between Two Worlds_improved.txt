# *Between Two Worlds*

Joshua Redfeather stared at the stack of bills in the safe, his fingers hovering over the combination lock. As head cashier at Westlake Financial Services, he was responsible for balancing the books each evening—a position of trust he'd worked hard to attain. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in the empty office, everyone else having gone home hours ago. The air smelled of printer toner and stale coffee, the artificial scent of the cleaning crew's pine-scented disinfectant lingering beneath it all.

His phone vibrated in his pocket. Louis again. The third call in an hour.

"I need that money by tomorrow morning, Josh," Louis's voice was tight with desperation. "You said you could get it. Twenty thousand. The combination to the safe, the security codes—you have everything you need."

Joshua closed his eyes, feeling the cold metal of the phone against his ear, his heartbeat quickening. Louis Westlake, the CEO's son and Joshua's childhood friend, had gambling debts that had spiraled out of control. Now loan sharks were threatening his life.

"It's embezzlement, Louis. I could go to prison."

"It's borrowing," Louis countered, his voice cracking. "Dad would never press charges against you. And I'll pay it back next month when my trust fund disbursement comes through."

Joshua's hand trembled as he spun the dial on the safe. Louis had been there for him when no one else was—when the other kids at their elite private school had discovered Joshua's mixed heritage and turned on him. Louis had remained his friend, had defended him, had given him connections that led to this job.

But stealing was wrong. Joshua had built his life on doing things the right way, on proving that he deserved every opportunity despite the prejudice he faced as a man with Native American ancestry on his father's side.

"I need more time to think," Joshua finally said, closing the safe with a heavy metallic thud that echoed in the empty office.

"There is no more time," Louis hissed. "They're going to kill me, Josh."

The next morning, Joshua arrived early at Riverpoint Park, his mind still churning with Louis's demand. He often came here before work, finding peace in the solitude and natural beauty before facing another day of subtle microaggressions and having to work twice as hard to be considered half as good.

The park was nearly empty at this hour, mist rising from the river as the sun began to peek over the horizon. The earthy scent of damp soil and river water filled his nostrils, and the distant calls of waking birds punctuated the stillness. Joshua followed his usual path, lost in thought, when a scream pierced the quiet morning.

Without hesitation, he sprinted toward the sound. At the river's edge, a woman was clinging to a fallen tree branch that extended over the water, her body dangling precariously above the rushing current. The branch was cracking, splintering under her weight, the sound like gunshots in the morning quiet.

Joshua didn't think—he acted. Scrambling down the embankment, he waded into the frigid water, the shock of cold stealing his breath as it soaked through his clothes and bit into his skin. He positioned himself beneath her.

"Let go!" he called. "I'll catch you!"

Their eyes met—hers wide with fear, a startling blue against her pale skin. She hesitated only a moment before the branch gave way with a final crack and she fell with a shriek. Joshua braced himself, catching her with enough force to send them both underwater momentarily. The roar of the current filled his ears as he fought against it, his muscles burning with the effort as he managed to drag them both to the shore.

They collapsed on the muddy bank, gasping for breath. The woman pushed wet blonde hair from her face, her expensive running clothes soaked and muddied, clinging to her slender frame.

"Thank you," she panted, her teeth chattering. "I thought I was going to die."

"Are you hurt?" Joshua asked, checking her for injuries, his hands shaking from cold and adrenaline.

"Just my pride," she said with a shaky laugh. "I was taking photos of a heron and leaned too far." She extended her hand. "I'm Isla Westlake."

Joshua froze. Westlake. Louis's sister. He'd seen her in photographs in Louis's office but had never met her in person. The irony wasn't lost on him—being asked to steal from her family one day and saving her life the next.

"Joshua Redfeather," he replied, taking her hand, feeling the softness of her palm against his calloused one.

Recognition flickered in her eyes. "You work for my father's company."

"I do. I'm the head cashier."

"Well, Joshua Redfeather, it seems I owe you my life."

What began as a chance rescue blossomed quickly. Isla insisted on buying Joshua coffee to thank him, which led to dinner the following evening. Their connection was immediate and powerful—both felt it, this inexplicable pull toward each other.

Isla was nothing like Joshua had expected. Despite her privileged upbringing, she was compassionate and keenly aware of social injustices. As the director of the Westlake Family Foundation, she worked to provide educational opportunities for underprivileged youth.

"My brother Louis was supposed to take over the foundation," she explained over dinner a week after their first meeting, twirling her wine glass between manicured fingers. The candlelight caught in her blue eyes as she spoke. "But he's not exactly reliable."

Joshua shifted uncomfortably at the mention of Louis, whom he'd been avoiding. "He has his struggles."

"That's a polite way of putting it," Isla said with a sad smile. "Our father enables him. Always has." She hesitated, setting down her glass. "I love my brother, but I'm not blind to his faults. Sometimes I wonder if I've been too harsh with him, pushing him away when he needed support."

As the weeks passed, Joshua found himself falling deeply in love with Isla. She was everything he'd ever wanted—intelligent, kind, passionate. And miraculously, she seemed to feel the same way about him.

But reality had a way of intruding on their happiness. The first time came at a charity gala where Isla had invited Joshua as her date. The ballroom glittered with crystal chandeliers and the clink of expensive glassware, the air heavy with perfume and privilege. Joshua tugged at his rented tuxedo collar, feeling out of place despite Isla's reassuring presence. He'd stepped away to get drinks when he overheard two board members whispering.

"Isn't that the Native American boy from accounting? What is Isla thinking?"

"You know how she is—always with her social justice causes. This is probably just her latest project."

The words stung, but Joshua had heard worse. What troubled him more was the realization that their relationship would never be simple. The Westlakes were one of the city's oldest, wealthiest families. Joshua, despite his education and career success, would always be seen as less than worthy by many in their circle.

And then there was Louis, who had been suspiciously quiet since Joshua had refused to steal the money. The other shoe would drop eventually—Joshua was sure of it.

---

It happened sooner than he expected. Three months into his relationship with Isla, Joshua received a call from his father.

"We need to talk, son," Charles Redfeather's voice was grave. "In person."

They met at the small apartment where Joshua had grown up. The familiar scent of sage and sweetgrass greeted him as he entered, his father's attempt to bring something of their ancestral traditions into this urban space. Charles, now in his sixties, still carried himself with the dignity that had sustained him through decades of discrimination and hardship. The lines around his eyes had deepened, his black hair now streaked with silver, but his gaze remained sharp and penetrating. As one of the few Native Americans to rise to a position of respect in the tribal council despite living off the reservation, Charles had taught Joshua to be proud of his heritage while navigating the white world.

"I've heard you're seeing the Westlake girl," Charles said without preamble, motioning for Joshua to sit at the worn kitchen table.

Joshua shouldn't have been surprised that his father knew. The tribal community was small, and news traveled fast.

"Her name is Isla, and yes, we're together."

Charles sighed heavily, his weathered hands wrapped around a mug of coffee. "The council has concerns, Joshua. We've had dealings with Westlake Enterprises before. They purchased land that contained sacred burial grounds ten years ago. Promised to preserve it, then built a shopping center. Your grandfather's remains were desecrated."

Joshua felt as if he'd been punched, the air leaving his lungs in a rush. "I didn't know."

"There's more. The council is currently negotiating with the state over water rights for the reservation. Westlake Enterprises has been lobbying against us, claiming their development projects should take priority." Charles leaned forward, his voice lowering. "The council believes your relationship could be used against us. Gerald Westlake might see his daughter's... involvement with you as leverage."

"That's ridiculous," Joshua protested, his chair scraping against the linoleum as he stood. "Isla isn't like that. And neither am I."

"Perhaps not intentionally," Charles conceded, the lines around his mouth deepening. "But these relationships don't exist in a vacuum, son. The council has asked me to tell you that they believe you should end this relationship. For the good of our people."

Joshua stood, anger rising in his chest, his hands clenching into fists at his sides. "So I'm supposed to give up someone I love because of her last name? How is that different from the discrimination we've fought against?"

"It's not about her name," Charles said quietly, his dark eyes reflecting a lifetime of hard-won wisdom. "It's about power. The Westlakes have it. We don't. History has shown us what happens when our people get caught in the middle."

---

That night, Joshua couldn't sleep. His father's words echoed in his mind, mingling with his own doubts. Was he being naive? Could a relationship between someone like him and someone like Isla ever truly work?

His phone lit up with a text from Louis: *We need to talk. Tomorrow. Your office. Noon.*

When Louis arrived the next day, he looked worse than Joshua had ever seen him—gaunt, with dark circles under bloodshot eyes, his designer clothes hanging loosely on his frame. The smell of stale cigarettes clung to him as he dropped into the chair across from Joshua's desk.

"You're sleeping with my sister," Louis said flatly.

"We're in a relationship," Joshua corrected, his voice tight. "It's serious."

Louis laughed bitterly, the sound like broken glass. "Of course it is. Perfect Isla and her perfect boyfriend. Does she know you almost stole from our family?"

Joshua tensed, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair. "That was your idea, not mine. And I said no."

"Which is why I'm in this mess!" Louis hissed, leaning across the desk. "They broke my fingers last week." He held up his hand, showing the splints. The bruising extended beyond the bandages, purple and yellow against his pale skin. "Next time it'll be worse."

"I'm sorry about that," Joshua said sincerely. "But I can help you get real help, Louis. Gambling addiction treatment—"

"Save it," Louis cut him off, his voice cracking. "Here's what's going to happen. You're going to break up with my sister, or I'm going to tell her and my father that you planned to embezzle company funds."

Joshua felt cold dread spreading through him. "They won't believe you."

"Won't they? The Indian boy from the wrong side of town, dating the heiress while plotting to steal from her family? It writes itself, Josh." Louis stood, wincing as he accidentally bumped his injured hand against the desk. "You have until the end of the week."

After Louis left, Joshua sat at his desk, feeling trapped between impossible choices. His obligation to Louis, who despite his flaws had been a true friend when Joshua needed one most. His obligation to his father and his people, who saw his relationship with Isla as a betrayal. And his obligation to his own heart, which had found in Isla a love he'd never thought possible.

---

That evening, Joshua met Isla at their favorite spot overlooking the city. The sun was setting, painting the sky in streaks of orange and purple, the city lights beginning to twinkle below them. The wind carried the scent of pine from the surrounding trees, mixing with the faint trace of Isla's jasmine perfume. Her smile faded when she saw his expression.

"What's wrong?" she asked, taking his hands, her touch warm against his cold fingers.

Joshua took a deep breath. "There's something I need to tell you. All of it."

And he did. He told her about Louis's gambling debts and the request to steal money. About his father's visit and the tribal council's concerns. About the desecrated burial grounds and the water rights negotiations. About Louis's threat.

When he finished, Isla was quiet for a long moment, her face pale in the fading light. "So everyone wants to keep us apart," she finally said, her voice barely audible above the wind. "My brother, your father, your tribe."

"It seems that way," Joshua admitted, his throat tight. "And maybe they're right. Maybe we're fooling ourselves thinking this could work."

"Is that what you believe?" Isla's blue eyes searched his face, a hint of vulnerability he'd never seen before flickering across her features.

"I believe I love you," Joshua said. "But I also believe love isn't always enough. The world doesn't just let people like us be together without a fight."

"Then we fight," Isla said, her voice strengthening though her hands trembled in his. "As for Louis, I'll handle him. His addiction has gone on long enough. My father needs to know the truth."

"And your father's company building on sacred burial grounds?"

Isla's face fell, genuine distress crossing her features. "I didn't know about that. I swear to you." She pulled her hands away, wrapping her arms around herself. "God, I feel so naive. I've been running the foundation, thinking I was doing good work, while my family's company..." She trailed off, shaking her head.

"It's not your fault," Joshua said gently.

"But it is my responsibility," Isla replied, a new determination hardening her gaze. "The foundation has the resources to help with land restoration and preservation. We can work with your tribal council. I'll need to learn more, understand what happened exactly."

"It won't be that simple," Joshua warned. "There's decades of mistrust to overcome. Your father might not support you in this."

"Then I'll fight him too," Isla said, her voice breaking slightly. "Joshua, all my life I've had everything handed to me except for one thing—someone who loves me for who I am, not what I represent. I found that in you, and I'm not giving it up without a fight." She paused, vulnerability returning to her eyes. "Unless... unless you want to end this. I would understand if it's too much."

Joshua pulled her close, feeling her heartbeat against his chest. "No. We face this together."

---

The months that followed tested them both. True to her word, Isla confronted her father about Louis, who was finally sent to a rehabilitation facility after a family intervention that left everyone emotionally drained. Gerald Westlake had raged, denied, and finally broken down when confronted with the extent of his son's addiction and the violent threats he faced.

"You should have come to me," he'd told Louis, his voice hollow with regret. "I would have helped you."

"Would you?" Louis had asked bitterly. "Or would you have just thrown money at the problem like always?"

The rehabilitation wasn't an instant fix. Louis struggled, relapsed once, then committed himself to recovery with a determination that surprised everyone. His relationship with Joshua remained strained, but there was a newfound respect between them—a recognition of shared struggle, albeit of different kinds.

Isla also initiated discussions with the tribal council about reparations for the desecrated burial grounds. The first meeting had been tense, held in the community center on the reservation. Joshua had accompanied her, feeling the weight of suspicious gazes from both sides.

"My family's company acted unconscionably," Isla had stated plainly to the assembled council members, her voice steady despite her obvious nervousness. "I'm not here to make excuses or to ask for forgiveness. I'm here to listen and to find a path toward making amends."

Elder Margaret Whitefeather, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun, had fixed Isla with a penetrating stare. "Pretty words. We've heard them before from your father. Why should we believe you're any different?"

"Because I'm not asking you to trust words," Isla had replied. "I'm asking you to judge actions. The foundation is prepared to fund whatever restoration efforts the council deems appropriate, and to establish legal protections for other sacred sites."

"And the water rights?" Charles had asked, glancing at his son.

"I've already spoken to my father about withdrawing Westlake support for the development project," Isla had said. "He... resisted. But I've made it clear that if he doesn't, I'll publicly oppose him through the foundation."

The council remained skeptical, but it was a beginning. Over the following months, Isla worked tirelessly, educating herself about Native American land rights and bringing in legal experts to help the tribe strengthen their position. She faced resistance from both her father's board and some council members who distrusted Westlake intentions, but she persisted with a humility that earned grudging respect.

"She's not what I expected," Charles admitted to Joshua after the third council meeting. "She listens more than she speaks."

"She's learning," Joshua said. "We both are."

Joshua faced his own battles. Some colleagues at work treated him differently once his relationship with Isla became public knowledge—some with resentment, others with false friendliness hoping to gain favor. The whispers followed him through the corridors: "sleeping his way to the top" and "diversity hire" among the kinder comments.

But through it all, their love deepened. They learned to navigate their different worlds together, supporting each other through the challenges that came with bridging such a divide. Isla began to see the subtle discrimination Joshua faced daily, while he gained insight into the gilded cage of privilege and expectation that had shaped her life.

"Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere," Isla confessed one night as they lay together, the moonlight casting shadows across their entwined bodies. "Too liberal for my family's world, too privileged to be taken seriously in yours."

"I know that feeling," Joshua said, tracing patterns on her bare shoulder. "Being mixed, I've never fully belonged in either world. But maybe that's not such a bad thing. Maybe we're building something new."

One year after their first meeting by the river, Joshua took Isla back to that spot at sunrise. The morning mist swirled around them as he knelt on one knee, the damp earth soaking through his jeans. Birds called to each other in the trees, and the river gurgled over stones, a constant reminder of how their story began.

"My father once told me that in our tradition, we believe that souls who are meant to find each other will, even across different worlds," he said, holding up a ring with a small turquoise stone set in silver, the metal cool against his fingers. "I believe we were meant to find each other, Isla. Will you marry me?"

Tears filled her eyes as she nodded, the rising sun catching in her blonde hair like a halo. "Yes. A thousand times yes."

As they embraced, Joshua felt a sense of peace wash over him. The path forward wouldn't be easy—there would always be those who disapproved, obstacles to overcome, prejudices to face. The tribal council was still divided on whether to accept the foundation's help. Gerald Westlake remained resistant to his daughter's relationship, though he'd grudgingly agreed to meet with Joshua's father to discuss the water rights issue. Louis was six months sober but still working to rebuild trust with everyone in his life.

But together, Joshua and Isla had found the strength to forge their own way, to honor their obligations to their families and communities while remaining true to themselves and their love. In bridging two worlds, they had created something new and beautiful—a future built on understanding, respect, and love that transcended the boundaries others had tried to impose upon them.

As they walked hand in hand along the riverbank where they'd first met, Joshua realized that sometimes the greatest act of courage isn't choosing between worlds, but creating a new one where both can exist together.
