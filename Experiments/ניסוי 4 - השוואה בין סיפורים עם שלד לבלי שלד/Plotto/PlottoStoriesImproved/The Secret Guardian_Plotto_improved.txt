# *The Secret Guardian*

Or Levine stared at the divorce papers on his desk, the weight of his obligation pressing down on him like a physical force. The fluorescent lights of his downtown Manhattan law office cast harsh shadows across the document, highlighting his signature in stark relief against the sterile white paper. The pen felt like lead in his hand. This would end his marriage to Lucy—not because he didn't love her anymore, but because he loved her too much to let her fall with him.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his corner office, the late afternoon sun painted the skyscrapers in hues of amber and gold. Three years ago, this view had represented everything he'd worked for since graduating from Columbia Law with honors. Now it felt like a gilded cage.

Three years ago, Or had been the rising star at Blackwell & Associates, a prestigious firm housed in a gleaming glass tower where the elevators moved with the silent efficiency of well-paid servants. It was there he'd met Lucy Chen, a brilliant environmental lawyer whose passion for justice matched his own. She'd been standing by the coffee machine on the thirty-second floor, cursing softly in Mandarin at the complicated settings.

"It has a mind of its own," Or had said, reaching past her to press the right combination of buttons. "Like most things in this building."

Lucy had smiled, the kind of smile that transformed her serious face into something luminous. "Thanks. I'm Lucy Chen, new to the environmental division."

"Or Levine. Corporate litigation, but don't hold it against me."

Their courtship had been swift and intense, culminating in a small but joyful wedding ceremony in Central Park, beneath a canopy of cherry blossoms. Lucy's parents had flown in from Taiwan, bringing with them traditional red envelopes and skeptical glances that softened when they saw how Or looked at their daughter. His own mother had wept openly, whispering that his father would have been proud, had he lived to see his son find such happiness.

For two years, they'd been blissfully happy, building a life together in their cozy Brooklyn brownstone apartment with its creaking hardwood floors and the small balcony where Lucy grew herbs in terracotta pots. On Sunday mornings, they would walk to the farmer's market hand in hand, arguing good-naturedly about whether cilantro was delicious or tasted like soap.

Then Adrian Mercer had joined the firm.

Adrian was everything Or wasn't—old money from Boston, Harvard Law connections, and a ruthless ambition that knew no bounds. He wore bespoke suits that cost more than Or's monthly mortgage payment and spoke with the easy confidence of someone who had never been told "no" in his life. From the moment he'd laid eyes on Lucy at the firm's Christmas party, Or had noticed the predatory gleam in Adrian's eyes as he watched her laugh, the champagne flute delicate in her hand, her black dress a stark contrast to her fair skin.

At first, Or had dismissed it as harmless attraction. Lucy was beautiful, after all, with her quick wit and infectious laugh that seemed to bubble up from some wellspring of joy inside her. But as the months passed, Adrian's interest had grown into an obsession. He found reasons to be in the elevator with her, to work late when she did, to comment on her cases with an intensity that went beyond professional interest.

"You're overthinking this," Lucy had told him when he'd voiced his concerns, her fingers working the knots from his shoulders as they sat on their worn leather couch, the sounds of Brooklyn traffic a distant hum through the windows. "Adrian's just being friendly. Besides, I'm married to you, remember?" She'd kissed him then, her lips tasting of the jasmine tea she favored, and for a moment, his worries had melted away.

But Or couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, especially when Adrian began maneuvering to work closely with Lucy on a high-profile environmental case against Meridian Chemicals. The case represented everything Lucy had gone to law school for—a chance to hold accountable a corporation whose toxic waste had poisoned the groundwater in Westside, a predominantly Black and Latino neighborhood in Queens. Children there were being diagnosed with rare cancers at six times the national rate. Elderly residents suffered from mysterious respiratory ailments. The case was career-making, and Lucy was thrilled to be leading it.

Or had tried to be supportive, bringing her dinner when she worked late and listening as she rehearsed her arguments. But the late nights and weekend work sessions with Adrian had planted seeds of doubt that grew like weeds in the garden of their marriage.

Then came the anonymous email with evidence that would destroy everything.

Or picked up his phone and scrolled to the message he'd received three weeks ago. The sender, using an encrypted address, had sent photographs of financial documents showing large sums of money—$250,000 in total—being transferred from Meridian Chemicals to an offshore account in the Cayman Islands linked to Or's name. The message was clear: "Drop the case or these go public. Your wife's career won't survive being married to a corrupt lawyer."

Or had never seen the account before, had never taken a bribe in his life. His father, a public defender who'd died of a heart attack when Or was in college, had instilled in him an unshakeable moral compass. "Justice isn't just a concept," he used to say. "It's a practice. Every day, you choose it."

But the paper trail was impeccable, crafted by someone who knew exactly how to make it look legitimate. Someone like Adrian, who had worked in financial law before joining Blackwell & Associates and whose family connections in banking could facilitate such transactions without questions.

The timing couldn't have been worse. Lucy was weeks away from presenting their case against Meridian, a company notorious for using its vast resources to crush opposition. If these documents surfaced, not only would Or face disbarment and criminal charges, but Lucy's case would be tainted by association. Years of work gathering testimonies from affected families—like the Riveras, whose eight-year-old daughter was in remission from leukemia, or Mrs. Washington, who at seventy-three had lost her husband and two neighbors to the same rare lung disease—would be wasted. Justice would be denied to communities already suffering.

Or had considered going to the police, but without proof of who had framed him, he'd only be fast-tracking his own destruction. He'd thought about confronting Adrian directly, but the man was too clever to leave evidence of his machinations. Adrian would simply deny everything, then accelerate his plan to ruin Or.

After sleepless nights weighing his options, the dark circles under his eyes deepening until Lucy had started asking if he was ill, Or had come to a painful conclusion: he needed to distance himself from Lucy to protect her career and the case. A divorce would create a clear separation between them professionally. It would hurt her—God, it would devastate her—but it was the only way to ensure that when the allegations inevitably came to light, she wouldn't be dragged down with him.

Or signed the papers with a heavy hand, his signature a jagged scar across the page. Tomorrow, he would file them and move out of their apartment while Lucy was at work, taking only what he needed. He would give no explanation, let her believe he was the villain. It was better this way.

As he slipped the papers into his briefcase, he allowed himself one moment of weakness, opening his wallet to touch the worn photo of Lucy he kept there—Lucy standing on the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset, the wind catching her hair, her smile wide and uninhibited. He traced her face with his fingertip, then closed the wallet with a decisive snap.

Lucy Chen slammed her office door, ignoring the concerned glances from colleagues through the glass walls. Six weeks had passed since Or had blindsided her with divorce papers and moved out without explanation. Six weeks of unanswered calls, of crying herself to sleep in their suddenly too-large bed, of wondering what she'd done wrong.

Her office, once a sanctuary of purpose, now felt like another place where she failed to understand what was happening in her life. The walls were lined with framed photographs of environmental restoration projects she'd helped make possible—a cleaned-up riverbank where children now played, a community garden built on land reclaimed from an industrial waste site. Achievements that had once filled her with pride now seemed hollow without Or to share them with.

"You deserve better," Adrian said, leaning against her doorframe with two coffee cups in hand. His tailored gray suit matched his eyes, which watched her with an intensity that once might have seemed like professional respect. "He clearly didn't appreciate what he had."

Lucy accepted the coffee with a tight smile, noticing how Adrian's fingers lingered against hers during the handoff. Adrian had been her rock through this ordeal, offering a sympathetic ear and stepping up as her partner on the Meridian case when she'd been too distraught to focus. His kindness was the only bright spot in her crumbling world, though something about his solicitousness occasionally struck a discordant note she couldn't quite identify.

"The preliminary hearing is tomorrow," she said, changing the subject. She gestured to the stack of folders on her desk. "I've been reviewing the testimonies from the Westside community. Their stories are heartbreaking. Maria Rivera showed me her daughter's medical bills yesterday—over $300,000 for cancer treatment. They've had to remortgage their house twice."

Adrian nodded, his expression appropriately solemn. "We're going to win this, Lucy. For them." He perched on the edge of her desk, closer than necessary. "And afterward, perhaps we could celebrate with dinner? You can't keep working yourself to death."

"Maybe," Lucy said noncommittally, relieved when her phone rang with a call from a community organizer in Westside.

As Adrian left her office, Lucy turned to her computer, determined to lose herself in work rather than dwell on her failed marriage or Adrian's increasingly transparent interest. An email notification popped up—from an address she didn't recognize. Normally, she'd ignore potential spam, but the subject line caught her attention: "About Or Levine."

Her heart racing, Lucy opened the email. It contained only a brief message: "Check the attached files. Your husband isn't who you think he is." The attachment was a folder of financial documents showing transactions between Meridian Chemicals and an account in Or's name.

Lucy felt the blood drain from her face, her hands growing cold as she scrolled through the damning evidence. This couldn't be right. Or was many things—apparently including a man who could walk away from their marriage without explanation—but he wasn't corrupt. He believed in justice as fiercely as she did. She'd seen him stay up all night preparing pro bono cases for tenants facing eviction. She'd watched him turn down lucrative clients whose ethics he questioned.

Unless... had he changed? Had the pressure of their careers, of competing with rising stars like Adrian, pushed him to compromise his values? The thought made her physically ill, a wave of nausea rising in her throat.

Lucy printed the documents and slipped them into her messenger bag, the leather worn soft from years of use. She needed answers, and there was only one person who could provide them.

Or's temporary apartment was a far cry from the home he'd shared with Lucy. A studio in a rundown building in Bushwick, with water stains on the ceiling and the constant rumble of the J train passing nearby. The walls were bare except for a single photograph—not of Lucy, which would hurt too much to see daily—but of the view from their Brooklyn apartment, the Manhattan skyline at dusk.

He'd furnished the place minimally: a futon that doubled as his bed, a rickety table with two mismatched chairs, and a desk where he spent his evenings combing through financial records, trying to trace the fake account back to Adrian. So far, he'd found nothing concrete, just circumstantial connections that wouldn't hold up in court—Adrian's cousin who worked at the bank where the offshore account had been established, a business trip to the Caymans that coincided with the account's creation.

The knock on his door startled him. No one knew where he lived now except his landlord, a taciturn man who communicated primarily through grunts and handwritten notes about building maintenance. Cautiously, Or approached the door and looked through the peephole.

Lucy.

His heart lurched painfully. She looked thinner, the sharp angles of her cheekbones more pronounced, with dark circles under her eyes that were visible even through the distorted view. Her hair, usually sleek and shining, was pulled back in a careless ponytail. For a moment, he considered not answering, sparing them both the pain of confrontation. But he owed her at least this much.

When he opened the door, Lucy pushed past him without greeting, the familiar scent of her jasmine perfume hitting him like a physical blow. Her face was a mask of controlled fury, but he could see the hurt beneath it, the confusion in her eyes that had once looked at him with such trust.

She threw a stack of papers onto his small dining table, the sound sharp in the quiet apartment.

"Explain these," she demanded, her voice steady despite the emotion he could see trembling just beneath the surface.

Or's stomach dropped as he recognized the financial documents. "Where did you get these?"

"Does it matter? Are they real, Or? Have you been taking bribes from Meridian?" Her voice cracked on the question, betraying how desperately she wanted him to deny it.

"No!" The denial burst from him with such force that Lucy took a step back. "Lucy, I would never. These are forgeries. Someone created them to frame me, to discredit your case against Meridian."

"Convenient explanation," she said, but there was a flicker of doubt in her eyes. "Why should I believe you when you walked out on our marriage without so much as a conversation? Three years together, and you couldn't even tell me to my face that you wanted out."

Or closed his eyes briefly, the pain of their separation hitting him anew. The apartment suddenly felt too small, the air between them charged with unspoken words. "I left to protect you."

"Protect me? From what?" Lucy's laugh was bitter, nothing like the warm sound he'd fallen in love with.

"From this," he gestured to the documents. "Someone set me up, Lucy. They created this paper trail to make it look like I've been compromised. If I stayed with you, your case against Meridian would be tainted by association. Everything you've worked for would be destroyed."

Lucy's expression shifted from anger to confusion, her legal mind already processing the implications. "Why didn't you tell me? We could have fought this together."

"Because I don't have proof of who did this," Or admitted, running a hand through his disheveled hair. "Just suspicions. And I couldn't risk your career, the case, everything you've worked for. Those families in Westside need you to win."

"Adrian," Lucy said suddenly, her eyes widening with realization. "It's Adrian, isn't it? He's been so supportive since you left, always there, always... watching." She paced the small room, connecting dots that had been there all along. "The way he touches my arm when we talk, how he always manages to be working late when I am. I thought he was being kind, but..."

Or nodded grimly. "He wants you, Lucy. He always has. And he wants my career destroyed in the process. Two birds, one stone."

Lucy sank into a chair, processing this betrayal. The metal legs scraped against the floor as she pulled it closer to the table. "The preliminary hearing is tomorrow. If these documents surface then..."

"Your case could be dismissed, and I'd be arrested," Or finished. "Adrian gets everything he wants—you, my downfall, and Meridian walks free."

Lucy's jaw set with determination, a look Or recognized from countless legal battles. It was the expression she wore when facing seemingly insurmountable odds—the same look she'd had when taking on her first major environmental case against a developer twice the size of their firm.

"Not if we stop him first," she said, reaching for Or's hand across the table. Her touch, after weeks of absence, sent electricity through him. "Tell me everything you know, everything you suspect. We have twelve hours to build a case against Adrian Mercer."

The courthouse steps were crowded with reporters and environmental activists supporting the case against Meridian. Signs bearing slogans like "Clean Water Is a Right" and "Justice for Westside" bobbed above the crowd. Maria Rivera stood at the front, her daughter Sophia beside her, the child's face still bearing the gaunt look of someone who had stared down mortality too young.

Lucy climbed the steps with purpose, her charcoal suit crisp and professional, her expression giving nothing away. Or followed at a distance as they'd planned, blending with the crowd of observers. Inside the marble-floored lobby, with its soaring ceilings and echoing acoustics, Adrian was waiting by the courtroom doors, his confident smile faltering when he spotted Lucy's resolute expression.

"Ready for the big day?" he asked, recovering quickly. He straightened his red silk tie, a power color chosen deliberately for the cameras that would be in the courtroom.

"More than ready," Lucy replied coolly. "I have some new evidence I'd like you to look at before we go in. Something that might strengthen our case."

She led him to a private conference room where Or was waiting. The room was small, with a polished oak table and leather chairs that spoke of legal tradition. Adrian's face darkened at the sight of Or, his carefully cultivated charm slipping to reveal something harder beneath.

"What is he doing here?" Adrian demanded, his hand on the doorknob as if to leave.

"Helping me understand some interesting financial documents that came into my possession," Lucy said, closing the door behind them with a decisive click. "Documents that show my husband taking bribes from Meridian."

Adrian's expression shifted to sympathy so practiced it was almost convincing. "I'm sorry you had to find out this way, Lucy. I suspected something wasn't right with Or's finances, but I didn't want to be the one to tell you. I know how much you loved him."

"That's funny," Or said, stepping forward, the fluorescent lights casting his face in sharp relief, "because the IT department at the firm confirmed that these documents were created on your computer, Adrian. Three weeks ago, right before you anonymously sent them to me with a threat to drop the case."

Adrian's face paled, a slight twitch in his left eye betraying his composure. "That's absurd. They can't possibly trace—"

"Metadata doesn't lie," Lucy interrupted, laying out printouts on the table. "Nor does the security footage from the firm showing you accessing the financial database after hours on March 12th. Or the recording I just made of you essentially admitting you knew about these documents before I showed them to you today."

She held up her phone, where the voice memo app was still running, the waveform pulsing with Adrian's recorded voice.

"Or the testimony from your cousin at First Cayman Bank," Or added, "who was quite forthcoming when faced with potential accessory charges. He confirmed you asked him to set up the account in my name."

Adrian lunged for the phone, but Or stepped between them, his larger frame blocking Adrian effectively. "It's over, Adrian. The judge has already been informed of your attempted sabotage of the case."

"You can't prove anything," Adrian snarled, but his confident facade was crumbling like the mask it had always been. His eyes darted around the room, calculating escape routes, weighing options.

"Actually, we can," Lucy said. "While you were busy trying to frame Or and seduce me, you got sloppy. The offshore account you created has your digital fingerprints all over it. The firm's cybersecurity team found the trail this morning—including emails from your personal account to Meridian's CEO discussing how to 'handle the Chen problem.'"

Two security officers entered the room, summoned by a text from Lucy. As they escorted a protesting Adrian away, Lucy turned to Or, tears welling in her eyes, catching the light like diamonds.

"You were willing to sacrifice everything for me, for this case," she said softly, her voice barely audible over the muffled sounds of the courthouse beyond the door. "You let me hate you to protect me."

Or reached for her hand tentatively, half-expecting her to pull away. "I couldn't see another way. I'm sorry for the pain I caused you. Every day we were apart felt like punishment."

"We could have faced this together," Lucy said, squeezing his hand. Her wedding ring was still on her finger, he noticed with a surge of hope. "Promise me, no more secrets, no more noble sacrifices without talking to me first. Marriage means facing things as a team, Or. The good and the bad."

"I promise," Or said, pulling her into an embrace that felt like coming home after a long, dark journey. The familiar curve of her body against his, the scent of her hair—it was everything he'd forced himself to live without. "Partners in everything, from now on."

Outside the conference room, the bailiff called their case. Through the window, Or could see Maria Rivera and her daughter waiting, their faces tense with hope. The Washingtons sat nearby, elderly Mrs. Washington clutching a framed photo of her late husband. These were the people Lucy fought for, the reason he'd been willing to give up everything.

Hand in hand, Or and Lucy walked into the courtroom, ready to face whatever came next—together. As the heavy doors closed behind them, Or felt the weight of secrets lifting from his shoulders, replaced by something lighter but stronger: the shared burden of truth, carried by two instead of one.
