## Overall Weighted Score: 3.7100

## Critical Assessment
"The Courage Talisman" is an exceptionally well-crafted story that effectively blends external journalistic drama with an internal journey of self-discovery. The narrative succeeds primarily through its strong character development, with Leo's transformation from timid lifestyle reporter to courageous investigative journalist forming a compelling arc. The parallel between Leo's personal growth and her professional challenge creates a satisfying symmetry, while the revelation about the talisman delivers a meaningful thematic payoff about the internal nature of courage. The prose is clean and professional, with a good balance of dialogue, action, and internal reflection.

## Suggestions for Improvement

* **Deepen the antagonist**: Richard Blackwood remains somewhat one-dimensional as a corporate villain. Adding more complexity to his character or showing his direct response to Leo's investigation would create a more nuanced conflict.

* **Expand the investigation process**: The week-long investigation is summarized briefly. Showing more specific challenges Leo faces while building her case would strengthen the middle section and make her triumph more earned.

* **Add more sensory detail**: While the writing is clear and effective, incorporating more sensory elements (sounds of the newsroom, smells of the parking garage, etc.) would create a more immersive reading experience.

* **Develop supporting characters**: Characters like Marcus could be given more dimension beyond their functional roles in Leo's journey, perhaps through brief glimpses of their own motivations or backgrounds.

* **Increase the stakes earlier**: While the pediatric version of the drug is mentioned later as raising the stakes, introducing this element earlier would heighten tension throughout the narrative.
