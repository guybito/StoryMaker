## Overall Weighted Score: 3.8975

## Summary Report:
"The Oath Between Us" is an exceptionally strong narrative that excels in character development, conflict construction, and logical coherence. The story presents a compelling moral dilemma through Eric's divided loyalties, developing this conflict with emotional depth and psychological realism. The narrative structure effectively balances action with introspection, creating a satisfying character arc that culminates in a meaningful transformation. The prose is clear and effective, though some physical descriptions could be more vivid.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Enhance setting descriptions**: While character and conflict are well-developed, physical settings could be rendered more vividly to create a stronger sense of place. The town of Millfield, the warehouse, and the prison visiting room would benefit from more sensory details.

* **Further develop Sarah's character**: As Eric's wife, Sarah plays an important role but receives relatively little development compared to other supporting characters. Expanding her perspective on Eric's dilemma would add another dimension to the family dynamics.

* **Show more of Eric's emotional states physically**: Some of Eric's internal struggles are told rather than shown through physical manifestations. Adding more observable reactions would strengthen the visual demonstrability of his emotional journey.
