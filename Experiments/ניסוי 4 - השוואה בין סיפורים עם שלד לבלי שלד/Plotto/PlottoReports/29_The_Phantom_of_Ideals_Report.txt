## Overall Weighted Score: 3.7175

## Short Report
"The Phantom of Ideals" is an exceptionally strong narrative that excels in character development, thematic depth, and emotional impact. The story's greatest strengths lie in its well-crafted protagonist whose transformation feels earned through genuine conflict and tragedy. The prose is polished and the narrative structure effectively builds tension toward a meaningful resolution. While there are minor opportunities for improvement in certain logical elements and visual descriptions, the story successfully delivers a powerful exploration of perfectionism, parental expectations, and the dangers of rigid idealism.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Strengthen the supernatural element** - The apparition of Damian on the cliff feels somewhat out of place in an otherwise realistic narrative. Either integrate this supernatural element more thoroughly throughout the story or consider a more realistic catalyst for Patrick's fall.

* **Develop Damian's perspective** - While we understand Patrick's journey thoroughly, Damian remains somewhat opaque until after his death. Consider adding a scene from his perspective or more detailed revelations about his internal struggle before the suicide to deepen the tragedy.

* **Enhance setting descriptions** - While character and conflict are excellently developed, the physical settings (university, home, cliff) could be rendered more vividly to create a stronger sense of place that reinforces the emotional landscape.

* **Clarify the academic fraud mechanics** - The specifics of how Damian maintained his academic deception for so long, especially in a field focused on ethics, could be more thoroughly explained to strengthen the story's plausibility.
