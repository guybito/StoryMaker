## Summary Report
"The Price of Dreams" is an exceptionally well-crafted story that excels in character development, conflict construction, and narrative logic. The protagonist's journey from trailer park to music therapy is compelling and emotionally resonant, with strong thematic exploration of class differences, authenticity, and the tension between practical necessity and personal passion. The supporting characters are well-developed and serve clear narrative functions, while the conflict escalates naturally toward a satisfying resolution that honors both the character's obligations and dreams.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
* **Enhance sensory details in key scenes** - While the descriptive writing is strong, adding more sensory elements (sounds, smells, textures) would further immerse readers in Paige's world, particularly during pivotal moments like her piano performances or hospital scenes.
* **Develop the music therapy work more specifically** - The resolution involving music therapy could benefit from more concrete details about how Paige's work impacts patients, showing rather than telling about her newfound purpose.
* **Consider expanding on Nathan's perspective** - While Nathan functions well as a supporting character, providing more insight into his thoughts about the class differences between him and Paige could add additional depth to their relationship dynamic.
