## Overall Weighted Score: 3.6425

## Summary Report
"Shadows at the Lighthouse" is a well-crafted literary story that successfully balances artistic themes with interpersonal drama. The dual protagonists are clearly defined with distinct personalities, goals, and arcs that culminate in meaningful transformation. The multiple layers of conflictâ€”professional rivalry, artistic integrity, potential betrayal, and romantic tensionâ€”create a compelling narrative that escalates effectively toward resolution. The prose is polished and descriptive, creating a vivid sense of place while maintaining narrative momentum. While some plot elements in the resolution feel slightly contrived, the overall story presents a cohesive and engaging exploration of artistic collaboration and personal growth.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Develop the resolution more gradually** - The current ending feels somewhat rushed and convenient. Expanding how Victor Crane is exposed and how the protagonists confront him would make the climax more satisfying and believable.

* **Provide more background on how Victor gained knowledge of Marcus's technique** - This key plot point needs clearer explanation to avoid feeling like a convenient plot device. Perhaps show earlier hints of information leakage or establish a more specific connection.

* **Balance the character development between Marcus and Eliza** - While both are well-drawn, Marcus receives more backstory and motivation. Developing Eliza's personal history and vulnerabilities more fully would strengthen her character and the romantic subplot.

* **Make the artistic techniques more visually demonstrable** - The innovative light photography that drives much of the plot remains somewhat abstract. More concrete, visual descriptions of what makes Marcus's work revolutionary would help readers better understand the stakes.

* **Integrate Catherine's character more thoroughly into the narrative** - Her role shifts from romantic complication to helpful messenger somewhat abruptly. A more gradual evolution of her relationship with Marcus would strengthen this subplot.
