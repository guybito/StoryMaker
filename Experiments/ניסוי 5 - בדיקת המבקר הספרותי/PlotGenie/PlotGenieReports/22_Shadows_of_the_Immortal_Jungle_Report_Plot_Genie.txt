    - Weighted Score: 0.0675

## Analysis Report
"Shadows of the Immortal Jungle" presents a compelling thriller with well-developed main characters whose personal stakes effectively drive the narrative. The story successfully balances action with character development, creating tension through both external dangers and interpersonal conflicts. While the plot is generally coherent and engaging, certain elements would benefit from more detailed explanation, particularly regarding Marco's apparent death and reappearance. The prose is clear and effective, though some scenes could be enhanced with more sensory details to fully immerse readers in the jungle setting.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Development**: Deepen the exploration of Sofia's conflicted feelings about her past with Dominguez. Was she truly just undercover, or did she have genuine feelings that complicate her current mission? This ambiguity could add compelling moral complexity.

* **Setting Description**: Enhance the sensory details of the jungle setting to create a more immersive atmosphere. The hostile environment could function almost as another antagonist, increasing tension throughout the journey.

* **Plot Clarification**: Provide clearer explanation for Marco's apparent death and reappearance during the compound infiltration. This moment creates confusion that temporarily pulls readers out of the story.

* **Show Don't Tell**: Convert some of the exposition about characters' feelings and motivations into demonstrable actions or dialogue that reveal these aspects more organically.

* **Pacing**: The final escape from Dominguez's compound feels somewhat rushed compared to the careful buildup. Expanding this section would create a more satisfying climactic sequence and better balance the narrative structure.
