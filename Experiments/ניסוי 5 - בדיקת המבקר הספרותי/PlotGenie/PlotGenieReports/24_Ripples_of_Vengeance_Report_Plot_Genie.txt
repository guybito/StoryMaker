## Overall Weighted Score: 3.7325

## Short Report
"Ripples of Vengeance" is a well-crafted narrative with strong character development and a compelling central conflict. The story effectively balances personal stakes with broader social issues, creating a multi-layered exploration of justice, grief, and power dynamics. The prose is clear and engaging, with particularly strong dialogue that reveals character while advancing the plot. While the resolution comes somewhat quickly and some plot mechanics could be more thoroughly explained, the emotional journey of the characters feels authentic and satisfying.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Develop the climactic sequence more fully** - The resolution through legal channels happens somewhat abruptly. Showing more of Olivia's interaction with the attorney general and the immediate aftermath of the charges would create a more satisfying climax to match the careful buildup.

* **Clarify Cassandra's evidence and motivation** - While her role is compelling, more specific details about how she obtained the evidence (especially video from two years ago) and why she chose this particular moment to come forward would strengthen the plot's credibility.

* **Add more sensory detail to key scenes** - While the prose is generally strong, some pivotal moments (like the strike at the mill) could benefit from more immersive sensory details to create truly memorable scenes that engage all the reader's senses.

* **Explore the developing relationship between Ethan and Olivia more deeply** - Their potential romantic connection is hinted at but could be developed more explicitly throughout the narrative to add emotional depth to their alliance.
