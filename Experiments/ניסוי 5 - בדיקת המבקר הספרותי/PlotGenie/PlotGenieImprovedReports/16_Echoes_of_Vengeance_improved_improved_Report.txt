## Overall Weighted Score: 3.7400

## Summary Report:
"Echoes of Vengeance" is a well-crafted academic drama that effectively explores themes of class struggle, institutional power, and the destructive nature of revenge. The story's greatest strengths lie in its character development, particularly the complex protagonist Elias Mercer, and the well-executed escalating conflict that builds to a satisfying climax and resolution. The narrative successfully balances external plot developments with internal character growth, creating a multidimensional story that engages readers on multiple levels. While there are minor opportunities for improvement in certain logical elements and scene descriptions, the overall quality of writing and storytelling is excellent.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen Jamie's initial motivation**: While her betrayal is well-executed, her original reasons for aligning with Richards could be more thoroughly developed to make her character arc more compelling. This would strengthen the emotional impact of her betrayal.

* **Expand the campus protest development**: The rapid escalation from personal conflict to campus-wide movement happens somewhat abruptly. Adding more gradual buildup would make this plot development more credible and impactful.

* **Enhance sensory details in key scenes**: While the writing is strong overall, certain pivotal moments (like the confrontation scene) could benefit from more sensory details to fully immerse readers in the emotional intensity of these encounters.

* **Further explore the institutional dynamics**: The story touches on fascinating aspects of academic politics and class divisions. Expanding on how these systemic issues affect multiple characters would add additional depth to the social commentary.
