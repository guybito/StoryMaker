## Overall Weighted Score: 3.5375

## Summary Report:
"The House Always Wins" is a well-crafted crime narrative with strong character development and a compelling central conflict that effectively drives the story forward. The protagonist's journey from loyal employee to disillusioned investigator creates an engaging character arc, while the betrayal by his mentor provides emotional depth. The story's strengths lie in its clear character motivations, escalating conflict, and thematic exploration of loyalty and integrity, though some aspects of the investigation process could benefit from greater realism and detail.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
* **Deepen the investigation process**: The methods by which Alex and Sophia gather evidence seem somewhat simplistic given the sophisticated nature of the criminal operation. More detailed and realistic investigative techniques would strengthen the plot's credibility.
* **Expand sensory descriptions**: While the story includes some effective descriptive passages, more consistent sensory details would create a more immersive experience, particularly in key settings like the casino floor.
* **Develop secondary characters**: Characters like Detective Chen remain functional rather than fully realized. Giving these supporting characters more dimension would enrich the narrative world.
* **Clarify the money laundering operation**: The mechanics of the criminal enterprise could be more clearly explained to help readers understand the stakes and complexity of what Alex is uncovering.
* **Balance exposition**: Some background information is delivered in extended paragraphs that slow the narrative pace. Integrating this information more organically into the action would improve flow.
