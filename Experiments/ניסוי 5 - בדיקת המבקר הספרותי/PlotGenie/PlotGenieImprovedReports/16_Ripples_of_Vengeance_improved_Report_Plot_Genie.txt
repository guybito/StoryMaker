## Overall Weighted Score: 3.8350

## Summary Report
"Ripples of Vengeance" is an exceptionally well-crafted story that excels in character development, conflict construction, and narrative craft. The dual protagonists are fully realized with clear motivations and meaningful character arcs. The central conflict involving justice for Thomas's death is compelling and escalates effectively throughout the narrative. The writing demonstrates strong technical skill with vivid descriptions that create a palpable sense of place. While there are minor logical questions regarding some plot elements, they don't significantly detract from the story's overall impact and coherence.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Background Depth**: While Thomas is central to the plot, we learn relatively little about him as a person beyond his relationships with Ethan and Olivia. Adding a few specific memories or characteristics would strengthen the emotional impact of his loss.

* **Antagonist Complexity**: The Blackwoods, particularly Jackson, could be developed with slightly more nuance to avoid veering toward one-dimensional villainy. A moment showing Victor's genuine affection for his son or Jackson's insecurity beneath his cruelty would add complexity.

* **Legal Process Realism**: The speed of the legal proceedings could be adjusted to better reflect real-world timelines, perhaps by indicating that preliminary actions are being taken while a full investigation is still developing.

* **Thomas's Presence at the Dock**: Clarify why Thomas was at the Blackwood dock on the night of his death to strengthen the logical foundation of this pivotal event and eliminate any reader questions about this crucial plot point.

* **Environmental Subplot Integration**: The environmental concerns regarding the Blackwoods' logging practices are introduced but could be more fully integrated into the resolution, perhaps by noting specific protective measures for the lake that will result from the investigation.
