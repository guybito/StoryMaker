The dual protagonists are thoroughly developed with clear motivations, weaknesses, and transformative arcs that feel authentic and earned.

## Suggestions for Improvement
While this story scores extremely highly, there are still minor areas that could be enhanced:

* Consider adding a brief scene showing Martin and Chloe's initial meeting at the charity gala to strengthen the emotional foundation of their relationship, helping readers understand what initially drew them together beyond their differences.
* The resolution, while satisfying, could benefit from a slightly more nuanced exploration of the lingering trust issues between the characters, acknowledging that such deep wounds take significant time to fully heal.
* The story might benefit from a more explicit exploration of how Martin's abandonment affected his legal and ethical responsibilities, particularly regarding his absence during Chloe's pregnancy.
