## Overall Weighted Score: 3.6875

## Summary Report:
"The Ghost of Vengeance" is a well-crafted psychological thriller that successfully blends elements of supernatural horror with a revenge narrative. The story's greatest strengths lie in its character development, particularly Walter's moral journey, and the compelling central conflict between Walter and Michael. The prose is polished and effective, creating tension while exploring themes of justice, vengeance, and moral complexity. While some plot elements strain credibility and the mysterious box's significance remains somewhat ambiguous, these minor issues don't significantly detract from the story's overall impact and thematic resonance.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Strengthen the box's significance**: The silver box serves as both catalyst and symbol, but its connection to the main conflict could be more integrated throughout. Consider making its symbolic meaning more explicit in relation to Walter's moral journey.

* **Enhance physical descriptions**: While character psychology is well-developed, more vivid physical descriptions would help readers visualize the characters and settings more completely.

* **Address logistical challenges**: Some readers might question how Michael managed his elaborate prison escape and technological haunting. Adding a few more details about his resources or connections would strengthen plausibility.

* **Clarify initial stakes**: While the conflict escalates effectively, establishing clearer stakes in the opening would help engage readers more immediately in Walter's predicament.

* **Expand supporting character development**: Characters like Robert and Anita serve their functions well but could be further developed to add additional dimensions to the narrative.
