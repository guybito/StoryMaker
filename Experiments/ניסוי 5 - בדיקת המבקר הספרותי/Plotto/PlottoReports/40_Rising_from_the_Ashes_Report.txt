## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Enhance sensory details in key scenes** to create a more immersive reading experience, particularly in emotionally charged moments like the confrontation with Logan or Isabella's decision to enter rehabilitation.

* **Develop the mechanism of Tessa's investigation** into Logan's background more thoroughly to strengthen the plausibility of how she so quickly uncovers information that eluded her mother.

* **Expand on Isabella's family background and wealth** to clarify the exact nature of her estrangement and provide more context for Logan's interest in potential family money.

* **Consider adding more external manifestations of Tessa's internal struggles** to make her emotional journey more visually demonstrable rather than relying primarily on internal thoughts.

* **Provide more concrete indicators of Isabella's long-term recovery** to strengthen the resolution and address the question of sustainability that remains somewhat open-ended.
