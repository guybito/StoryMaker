# *The Reflection of Beauty*

Sienna Matthews had always believed she was beautiful. Not just pretty or attractive, but genuinely, head-turningly beautiful. This conviction had formed the cornerstone of her identity since childhood, despite the fact that by conventional standards, she was decidedly plain. Her mousy brown hair lacked luster, her features were unremarkable, and her figure was average at best. Yet somehow, when Sienna looked in the mirror, she saw someone else entirely—someone with radiant skin, captivating eyes, and an ethereal presence.

This disconnect between perception and reality had been carefully cultivated by her mother, Zara. A former beauty queen whose own looks had faded with time, Zara had transferred her vanity and ambitions onto her only daughter. "You're the most beautiful girl in any room," she would whisper to Sienna before school events. "They're all just jealous of you." These affirmations, repeated throughout Sienna's formative years, had calcified into an unshakable belief system.

At twenty-eight, Sienna worked as a junior marketing executive at Lumineux, a mid-sized cosmetics company in Chicago. The open-plan office buzzed with activity as Sienna sat at her desk, scrolling through emails with a perpetual frown creasing her forehead. The fluorescent lights overhead cast harsh shadows on her heavily made-up face.

"Did you see the quarterly report?" asked Daphne from the neighboring cubicle, her voice cautious. "Marketing exceeded projections by twelve percent."

"I'm sure my campaign for the hydrating serum was responsible," Sienna replied without looking up. "I told them the influencer strategy would work."

Daphne's lips thinned. "Actually, that was Raj's strategy. You worked on the moisturizer line."

Sienna's head snapped up. "I gave him that idea in the first place. He just implemented it."

Daphne sighed, gathering her papers. "Team meeting in five minutes," she said, retreating.

Sienna had been at Lumineux for five years with minimal advancement, a situation she attributed to jealousy from her female superiors and unwanted attention from male colleagues. The truth—that her perpetual frown, constant complaints, and tendency to take credit for others' work made her difficult to promote—remained invisible to her.

Later that day, Sienna aggressively stirred her afternoon coffee in the break room, the metal spoon clanging against ceramic. The rich aroma of fresh coffee filled the small space, but did nothing to improve her mood.

"They'll recognize my talents eventually," she muttered to herself. Her colleague, Daphne, offered a tight smile before quickly exiting. Sienna interpreted this as another example of intimidation rather than what it actually was: avoidance.

In the team meeting that followed, Sienna sat with arms crossed as her supervisor, Elaine, presented the marketing calendar for the upcoming quarter.

"I'd like Raj and Daphne to lead the summer campaign," Elaine announced, her gaze deliberately avoiding Sienna's corner of the conference table.

"Excuse me," Sienna interrupted, the fluorescent lights glinting off her glossy lipstick. "I have extensive experience with summer campaigns. I should be leading this."

A uncomfortable silence fell over the room. The air conditioning hummed in the background.

"Sienna," Elaine said carefully, "we discussed this during your last performance review. You need to demonstrate more collaborative skills before taking on leadership roles."

Sienna's cheeks burned. She spent the remainder of the meeting scribbling furious notes, already composing her third complaint to HR this year.

Sienna's apartment was a shrine to her perceived beauty—multiple mirrors strategically placed to catch her reflection at flattering angles, shelves crowded with expensive beauty products, and a closet full of clothes one size too small that she was perpetually "about to fit into." The scent of expensive perfume permeated every room, masking the underlying mustiness of a space that was more staged than lived in.

Each evening, she performed an elaborate skincare ritual at her vanity, the soft glow of her makeup lights creating the illusion of perfection she craved. The reality of her financial struggles—credit card debt mounting from unnecessary purchases and a salary that hadn't increased in years—was another truth she refused to acknowledge. The stack of past-due notices sat unopened on her kitchen counter, gathering dust beside an untouched fruit bowl.

Her mother, Zara, now sixty-three, remained her most steadfast supporter and enabler. Their Sunday brunches were ritual affirmation sessions where Zara would reinforce Sienna's distorted self-image while criticizing everyone else in their orbit.

"Did you see how that waitress looked at you?" Zara whispered during one such brunch at Maison Dorée, their favorite café. The clinking of silverware and murmur of conversation provided a backdrop to their conspiratorial exchange. "Pure envy. You should complain about her service."

Sienna nodded, scanning the restaurant for admirers she believed must be watching her. The sunlight streaming through the windows caught on her heavily highlighted hair, which she tossed with practiced nonchalance. "I think I'm going to apply for the senior marketing position that just opened up," she announced. "It's about time they recognized my potential."

Zara beamed with pride, her own face tightly stretched from recent cosmetic procedures. "Of course you should! You're the most qualified person there."

What neither of them acknowledged was that Sienna had been passed over for three promotions already, each time responding with increasingly bitter complaints to HR rather than self-reflection.

The following week, a deadly flu outbreak hit Chicago. The virus spread rapidly, overwhelming hospitals and causing widespread panic. The normally bustling streets grew quiet, and the few pedestrians who ventured out wore masks and kept their distance from one another. News reports described overcrowded emergency rooms and exhausted medical staff.

When the illness struck Miles Abernathy, the elderly man who lived across the hall from Sienna, the entire building's residents retreated in fear. Miles had no family nearby, and the building manager posted a desperate plea for someone to check on him, as emergency services were stretched beyond capacity.

Sienna, passing the notice in the lobby, paused. The normally pristine marble floor was dulled from lack of maintenance, and the usual doorman was absent—another casualty of the outbreak. Despite her many flaws, she had always harbored a genuine belief in being special—not just in appearance, but in purpose. Here was an opportunity to prove her exceptional nature to everyone.

"I'll do it," she told the surprised building manager. "I'll look after Mr. Abernathy."

The manager, a practical woman named Gloria, eyed her skeptically. Her gray hair was pulled back in a severe bun, and deep lines framed her mouth—the kind of aging Sienna feared most. "This isn't a game, Sienna. The virus is highly contagious, and Miles is very ill. The health department has advised minimal contact."

"I understand the risks," Sienna replied, already imagining the admiration she would receive. "Someone has to help him."

That evening, armed with disinfectant, masks, and gloves provided by Gloria, Sienna knocked on Miles's door. The weak "come in" that followed revealed the gravity of his condition.

Miles Abernathy's apartment was sparse but meticulously organized—the home of a man who valued function over form. Now, however, it was clear he had been unable to care for himself for days. Dishes were piled in the sink, and the air was stale with sickness—a heavy, sour smell that made Sienna instinctively hold her breath.

Miles himself was a frail figure huddled under blankets on his couch, his breathing labored and his eyes glassy with fever. At seventy-eight, he had the distinguished look of a former academic, which indeed he had been—a professor of philosophy now long retired. His silver hair was matted with sweat, and his thin hands trembled as they clutched a half-empty glass of water.

"Ms. Matthews," he wheezed, recognizing her from their infrequent elevator encounters. "You shouldn't be here. It's not safe."

"Nonsense," Sienna replied, setting down her supplies with a clatter that seemed too loud in the quiet apartment. "Everyone else is too afraid, but I'm not. I'm going to help you get better."

Over the next three days, Sienna established a routine. She would visit Miles three times daily—morning, afternoon, and evening—to provide medication, food, and basic care. She documented her efforts meticulously on social media, carefully framing herself as the building's selfless hero. Each post garnered likes and comments praising her courage, feeding her need for validation.

What surprised her was how Miles, even in his weakened state, treated her. Unlike most people who seemed put off by her fretful disposition, Miles spoke to her with genuine interest and respect. He asked questions about her life and actually listened to her answers without the usual glazing of eyes she encountered elsewhere.

"Tell me about your work," he asked on the third day, his voice slightly stronger as the medication began to take effect. The afternoon light filtered through dusty blinds, casting long shadows across the room.

"I'm in marketing," Sienna replied, arranging his pillows. "I should be running campaigns by now, but my boss keeps overlooking me."

"What do you enjoy about marketing?" Miles asked, his eyes clear despite his illness.

The question caught her off guard. No one had ever asked what she enjoyed about her work—only what she had accomplished or what title she held.

"I... I like creating something that resonates with people," she admitted after a pause. "When I can find the right message that makes someone feel understood."

Miles nodded thoughtfully. "That's a valuable skill. Do you get to use it often?"

"Not as much as I'd like," Sienna said, realizing with some discomfort that she spent more time complaining about recognition than seeking opportunities to create meaningful work.

On the fourth day, as Miles's fever finally broke, Sienna arrived to find him sitting up and alert for the first time. The curtains were drawn back, allowing natural light to fill the apartment. The air smelled fresher—Miles had managed to open a window slightly.

"You've been very kind," he said, his voice stronger than before. "May I ask why you volunteered when no one else would?"

The question caught Sienna off guard. Her rehearsed response about civic duty suddenly felt hollow. "I... I suppose I wanted to prove I could do something important," she admitted.

Miles nodded thoughtfully. "And have you proven it?"

"I'm not sure," Sienna said, realizing with some surprise that the social media validation she'd been receiving felt increasingly empty compared to the actual experience of helping someone.

As Miles recovered over the next week, their conversations deepened. A former ethics professor, he gently challenged Sienna's perspectives without ever directly criticizing her. For perhaps the first time in her adult life, Sienna found herself engaged in conversations that weren't centered on her appearance or grievances.

"What did you teach?" she asked one evening as she prepared a simple dinner in his kitchen. The smell of chicken soup filled the apartment, a comforting contrast to the antiseptic scent of cleaning products.

"Ethics, primarily," Miles replied from his seat at the small dining table. "I was particularly interested in how we construct our identities and the moral implications of self-deception."

Sienna nearly dropped the ladle she was holding. "Self-deception?"

"Yes," Miles said, his eyes kind but penetrating. "The ways we lie to ourselves to avoid painful truths. It's a fascinating area of study—how we create narratives about ourselves that may not align with reality."

Sienna changed the subject quickly, but the words lingered in her mind long after she returned to her own apartment that night.

One evening, as she was preparing to leave after delivering Miles's dinner, she overheard him speaking on the phone in his bedroom, the door slightly ajar. The soft murmur of his voice drew her closer, her footsteps silent on the carpeted floor.

"Yes, she's still coming by," Miles was saying. "No, Gloria, she's nothing like you described. Beneath all that fretfulness, there's someone quite different trying to emerge."

Sienna froze, realizing they were discussing her. The hallway suddenly felt too narrow, the air too thin.

"The constant complaints and self-absorption—it's all armor," Miles continued. "She's been told her whole life that her value lies in a beauty she doesn't possess, so she's created this entire persona to protect herself from that truth. It's making her miserable, and everyone around her too. But these past days, when she forgets to maintain the facade... there's a thoughtful, capable person there."

Sienna backed away silently, her cheeks burning with shame and anger. Her first instinct was to storm in and defend herself, to accuse Miles of betrayal after all she'd done for him. Instead, she quietly gathered her things and left, the words echoing painfully in her mind.

That night, Sienna couldn't sleep. She paced her apartment, alternating between rage and an unfamiliar feeling of hollow uncertainty. The moonlight cast strange shadows through her many mirrors, reflecting and refracting until she felt surrounded by distorted versions of herself.

Around dawn, exhausted, she found herself staring at her reflection in her bedroom mirror—really staring, perhaps for the first time in years. The harsh morning light was unforgiving, revealing the fine lines around her eyes, the artificial quality of her highlighted hair, the tightness around her mouth from years of discontent.

What she saw was not the goddess her mother had convinced her was, nor was she the plain, unremarkable woman others might describe. She was simply Sienna—a woman whose perpetual dissatisfaction had etched premature lines around her mouth, whose eyes reflected not beauty but a desperate need for validation.

"Who am I without this?" she whispered to her reflection, touching the elaborate makeup she applied even before bed. Her finger traced a path through the foundation on her cheek, revealing the natural skin beneath—neither perfect nor flawed, just human.

The next morning, Sienna called in sick to work—something she never did, priding herself on perfect attendance. Instead, she visited her mother's apartment unannounced.

Zara opened the door in a silk robe, her face covered in an expensive cream. The familiar scent of her mother's perfume—heavy and cloying—filled the entryway. "Sienna! What are you doing here? Is everything alright?"

"We need to talk, Mom," Sienna said quietly, stepping inside. The apartment was a more elaborate version of her own—mirrors everywhere, beauty products covering every surface, fashion magazines stacked in precise piles.

The conversation that followed was painful for both of them. Sienna confronted her mother about the lifetime of false affirmations, the unrealistic expectations, and the constant reinforcement of vanity over substance. As she spoke, she noticed for the first time the deep sadness in her mother's eyes, visible beneath the carefully maintained exterior.

"Why did you do it?" Sienna finally asked, her voice breaking. "Why make me believe I was something I'm not?"

Zara, stripped of her usual bravado, looked suddenly old and vulnerable. She sank into her white leather sofa, the plush cushions seeming to swallow her diminished frame. "Because I couldn't bear for you to feel ordinary," she admitted. "I was ordinary, and it broke me. I thought I was protecting you."

"But you weren't," Sienna replied. "You were setting me up for a lifetime of disappointment."

Zara's hands trembled as she reached for her daughter's. "I didn't know any other way to love you," she whispered. "My mother taught me that beauty was everything. I thought I was giving you confidence."

For the first time, Sienna saw her mother clearly—not as the glamorous, controlling figure who had shaped her distorted self-image, but as a woman who had herself been damaged by impossible standards.

When Sienna returned to Miles's apartment that afternoon, she looked different. She had washed off her heavy makeup and pulled her hair back simply. The weight of her usual cosmetic armor was absent, making her movements lighter, more natural. Miles, now able to move around his apartment with assistance, noticed immediately but said nothing.

"I heard what you said about me on the phone," Sienna said without preamble, standing in the center of his living room. The afternoon sun cast her shadow long across the floor. "You were right."

Miles nodded slowly. "I'm sorry you had to hear it that way."

"I'm not," Sienna replied. "I needed to hear it. I've been making myself and everyone around me miserable because I couldn't accept who I really am."

Over the next two weeks, as Miles continued to recover, Sienna underwent her own transformation. The process was neither quick nor easy. Years of habitual behavior couldn't be undone overnight, and she often caught herself slipping back into old patterns—checking her reflection obsessively, framing interactions in terms of jealousy or admiration, focusing on perceived slights.

But slowly, she began to recognize how her fretful disposition and constant complaints had alienated colleagues and potential friends. She started listening more than speaking, observing more than demanding attention.

At work, the change was gradual but noticeable. Instead of immediately challenging Elaine's decisions in the morning meeting, Sienna took notes and asked thoughtful questions. The conference room, once tense when she entered, began to feel less charged. The fluorescent lights that had seemed so harsh now simply illuminated her workspace.

After a particularly productive brainstorming session where she had built on Raj's idea rather than dismissing it, Daphne approached her desk.

"That was a good suggestion about targeting the eco-conscious demographic," Daphne said, her usual wariness replaced by cautious appreciation. "Would you want to grab coffee sometime and discuss it further?"

The invitation—simple, collegial—would have seemed beneath Sienna's notice a month ago. Now, it felt like a small victory.

She approached her supervisor with a new attitude, asking for specific feedback on how she could improve rather than complaining about being overlooked. The change was so dramatic that her team began cautiously including her in projects and social events.

"I'd like to understand why my last campaign didn't perform as expected," she told Elaine during their one-on-one meeting. The office was quiet, most colleagues having left for the day. "I want to learn from it."

Elaine's surprise was evident, but she recovered quickly. "The concept was strong," she said carefully, "but you didn't incorporate feedback from the team. Marketing is collaborative, Sienna. Your ideas have value, but they're stronger when refined through teamwork."

Instead of the defensive response that would have once been automatic, Sienna nodded. "I see that now. I'd like to work on being more receptive to input."

But as Miles improved, Sienna began to feel increasingly unwell. At first, she dismissed it as exhaustion from her caregiving duties and the emotional upheaval of confronting long-held delusions. Then came the fever, the aching joints, the difficulty breathing.

She had contracted the virus despite her precautions. Unlike Miles, whose symptoms had eventually plateaued, Sienna's condition deteriorated rapidly. Her compromised immune system—weakened by years of crash diets, chronic stress, and the habit of working through illnesses to maintain her perfect attendance—couldn't fight the infection effectively.

The first day she felt truly ill, she tried to hide it from Miles during her visit. But as she stood in his kitchen preparing tea, a wave of dizziness overcame her. The room tilted alarmingly, the kettle's whistle seeming to come from very far away.

"Sienna?" Miles's concerned voice barely penetrated the ringing in her ears. "You're unwell."

"I'm fine," she insisted, even as she gripped the counter for support. The cool granite beneath her palms was the only solid thing in a suddenly unstable world.

"You're not," Miles said firmly. "You've contracted it, haven't you? You need to see a doctor immediately."

Within days, she was hospitalized in critical condition. The hospital room was stark and impersonal—white walls, beeping monitors, the antiseptic smell that couldn't quite mask the underlying scent of sickness. The oxygen mask over her face made speech difficult, and the constant presence of nurses in protective gear created a surreal atmosphere of isolation despite the care.

From her hospital bed, drifting in and out of consciousness, Sienna experienced a clarity that had eluded her in health. The doctors were not optimistic about her chances, and she knew it. Yet strangely, she felt at peace. In her final weeks, she had glimpsed who she could have been without the burden of false ideals—someone capable of genuine connection, of meaningful contribution.

Miles, now recovered enough to leave his apartment, visited her daily, reading to her from philosophy texts when she was conscious enough to listen. His voice, steady and comforting, became her anchor to the waking world as her condition worsened.

"Plato believed that true beauty was found in the realm of ideas," he read one afternoon, the sunlight from the window creating a halo around his silver hair. "That physical beauty was merely a shadow of something more profound and lasting."

Sienna's mother, Zara, sat vigil by her bedside, her makeup washed away by tears, finally seeing her daughter clearly. The harsh hospital lighting revealed every line on her face, every gray root in her hair—imperfections she had spent a lifetime concealing now exposed in her grief.

"I'm so sorry," Zara whispered, clutching Sienna's hand. "I should have taught you to value yourself for who you are, not what you look like."

On her last lucid day, three weeks after first falling ill, Sienna managed to speak to them both. The effort of removing her oxygen mask for even a few moments left her gasping, but she was determined.

"I was wrong about so many things," she whispered, her voice barely audible above the mechanical hum of medical equipment. "But in the end, I got to be the person I should have been all along. That's something, isn't it?"

Miles nodded, his eyes bright with unshed tears. "It's everything, Sienna. To see oneself truly is the work of a lifetime. You've accomplished it in weeks."

Zara could only sob, pressing her daughter's hand to her cheek.

Three days later, Sienna Matthews died from complications of the virus. The funeral was small but attended by more people than might have been expected a month earlier—colleagues who had glimpsed a different Sienna in her final weeks, neighbors touched by her sacrifice for Miles, and even Gloria, the building manager who had witnessed her transformation.

The cemetery was quiet except for the rustle of autumn leaves and the distant sound of city traffic. The simple casket was adorned with white lilies—no ostentation, no excess, just natural beauty.

Miles, still weak but determined to honor her, delivered a eulogy that captured not who Sienna had been for most of her life, but who she had become at the end.

"Sienna Matthews discovered something many of us never do," he said, his voice steady despite his grief. "She learned that true beauty lies not in appearance or in the validation of others, but in the courage to see oneself clearly and choose to change. In her final act of service, she found the ideals worth cherishing—compassion, honesty, and the capacity for growth. She may have left us too soon, but she left having corrected the error that defined her life. There is profound beauty in that."

As the small gathering dispersed, Zara approached Miles, her face bare of makeup for the first time in decades. The autumn wind tousled her hair, revealing gray roots she no longer tried to hide.

"Thank you," she said simply. "For helping her see what I couldn't show her."

Miles nodded, understanding the complex grief of a mother who had loved imperfectly but completely. "She helped me too," he replied. "More than she ever knew."

In the weeks that followed, small changes rippled outward from Sienna's brief life. At Lumineux, Elaine instituted a mentorship program to help junior staff develop collaborative skills. Daphne kept a photo of their team, including Sienna, on her desk—a reminder of unexpected transformations. Zara began volunteering at a girls' empowerment program, teaching young women that their value extended far beyond appearance.

And in Miles's apartment, a single photograph stood on his bookshelf—Sienna in her final days, without makeup or pretense, her smile genuine despite her illness. In death, Sienna Matthews finally achieved what had eluded her in life—she became truly beautiful, not by the standards she had desperately pursued, but by the measure of a life, however brief, that had ultimately found its truth.
