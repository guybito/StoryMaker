# The Secret Guardian

Or Levine stared at the divorce papers on his desk, the weight of his obligation pressing down on him like a physical force. The fluorescent lights of his downtown law office cast harsh shadows across the document that would end his marriage to Lucy. It wasn't that he didn't love her anymore—quite the opposite. His heart ached with the knowledge that this painful decision was the only way to protect her.

Three years ago, Or had been the rising star at Blackwell & Associates, a prestigious law firm where he'd met Lucy Chen, a brilliant environmental lawyer with a passion for justice that matched his own. Their courtship had been swift and intense, culminating in a small but joyful wedding ceremony in Central Park. For two years, they'd been blissfully happy, building a life together in their cozy Brooklyn apartment.

Then Adrian Mercer had joined the firm.

Adrian was everything Or wasn't—old money, ivy league connections, and a ruthless ambition that knew no bounds. From the moment he'd laid eyes on Lucy at the firm's Christmas party, Or had noticed the predatory gleam in Adrian's eyes. At first, Or had dismissed it as harmless attraction. Lucy was beautiful, after all, with her quick wit and infectious laugh. But as the months passed, Adrian's interest had grown into an obsession.

"You're overthinking this," Lucy had told him when he'd voiced his concerns. "Adrian's just being friendly. Besides, I'm married to you, remember?" She'd kissed him then, and for a moment, his worries had melted away.

But Or couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, especially when Adrian began maneuvering to work closely with Lucy on a high-profile environmental case against Meridian Chemicals. The case was career-making, and Lucy was thrilled to be leading it. Or had tried to be supportive, but the late nights and weekend work sessions with Adrian had planted seeds of doubt.

Then came the anonymous email with evidence that would destroy everything.

Or picked up his phone and scrolled to the message he'd received three weeks ago. The sender, using an encrypted address, had sent photographs of financial documents showing large sums of money being transferred from Meridian Chemicals to an offshore account linked to Or's name. The message was clear: "Drop the case or these go public."

Or had never seen the account before, had never taken a bribe in his life. But the paper trail was impeccable, crafted by someone who knew exactly how to make it look legitimate. Someone like Adrian, who had worked in financial law before joining Blackwell & Associates.

The timing couldn't have been worse. Lucy was weeks away from presenting their case against Meridian, a company notorious for dumping toxic waste in low-income neighborhoods. If these documents surfaced, not only would Or face disbarment and criminal charges, but Lucy's case would be tainted by association. Years of work gathering testimonies from affected families would be wasted. Justice would be denied to communities already suffering.

Or had considered going to the police, but without proof of who had framed him, he'd only be fast-tracking his own destruction. He'd thought about confronting Adrian directly, but the man was too clever to leave evidence of his machinations.

After sleepless nights weighing his options, Or had come to a painful conclusion: he needed to distance himself from Lucy to protect her career and the case. A divorce would create a clear separation between them professionally. It would hurt her—God, it would devastate her—but it was the only way to ensure that when the allegations inevitably came to light, she wouldn't be dragged down with him.

Or signed the papers with a heavy hand. Tomorrow, he would file them and move out of their apartment while Lucy was at work. He would give no explanation, let her believe he was the villain. It was better this way.

Lucy Chen slammed her office door, ignoring the concerned glances from colleagues. Six weeks had passed since Or had blindsided her with divorce papers and moved out without explanation. Six weeks of unanswered calls, of crying herself to sleep, of wondering what she'd done wrong.

"You deserve better," Adrian said, leaning against her doorframe with two coffee cups in hand. "He clearly didn't appreciate what he had."

Lucy accepted the coffee with a tight smile. Adrian had been her rock through this ordeal, offering a sympathetic ear and stepping up as her partner on the Meridian case when she'd been too distraught to focus. His kindness was the only bright spot in her crumbling world.

"The preliminary hearing is tomorrow," she said, changing the subject. "I've been reviewing the testimonies from the Westside community. Their stories are heartbreaking."

Adrian nodded, his expression appropriately solemn. "We're going to win this, Lucy. For them."

As he left her office, Lucy turned to her computer, determined to lose herself in work rather than dwell on her failed marriage. An email notification popped up—from an address she didn't recognize. Normally, she'd ignore potential spam, but the subject line caught her attention: "About Or Levine."

Her heart racing, Lucy opened the email. It contained only a brief message: "Check the attached files. Your husband isn't who you think he is." The attachment was a folder of financial documents showing transactions between Meridian Chemicals and an account in Or's name.

Lucy felt the blood drain from her face. This couldn't be right. Or was many things—apparently including a man who could walk away from their marriage without explanation—but he wasn't corrupt. He believed in justice as fiercely as she did.

Unless... had he changed? Had the pressure of their careers, of competing with rising stars like Adrian, pushed him to compromise his values? The thought made her physically ill.

Lucy printed the documents and slipped them into her bag. She needed answers, and there was only one person who could provide them.

---

Or's temporary apartment was a far cry from the home he'd shared with Lucy. A studio in a rundown building, with bare walls and minimal furniture. He spent his evenings there combing through financial records, trying to trace the fake account back to Adrian. So far, he'd found nothing concrete, just circumstantial connections that wouldn't hold up in court.

The knock on his door startled him. No one knew where he lived now except his landlord. Cautiously, he approached the door and looked through the peephole.

Lucy.

His heart lurched painfully. She looked thinner, with dark circles under her eyes that were visible even through the distorted view. For a moment, he considered not answering, sparing them both the pain of confrontation. But he owed her at least this much.

When he opened the door, Lucy pushed past him without greeting, her face a mask of controlled fury. She threw a stack of papers onto his small dining table.

"Explain these," she demanded.

Or's stomach dropped as he recognized the financial documents. "Where did you get these?"

"Does it matter? Are they real, Or? Have you been taking bribes from Meridian?"

"No!" The denial burst from him with such force that Lucy took a step back. "Lucy, I would never. These are forgeries."

"Convenient explanation," she said, but there was a flicker of doubt in her eyes. "Why should I believe you when you walked out on our marriage without so much as a conversation?"

Or closed his eyes briefly, the pain of their separation hitting him anew. "I left to protect you."

"Protect me? From what?"

"From this," he gestured to the documents. "Someone set me up, Lucy. They created this paper trail to make it look like I've been compromised. If I stayed with you, your case against Meridian would be tainted by association."

Lucy's expression shifted from anger to confusion. "Why didn't you tell me? We could have fought this together."

"Because I don't have proof of who did this," Or admitted. "Just suspicions. And I couldn't risk your career, the case, everything you've worked for."

"Adrian," Lucy said suddenly, her eyes widening with realization. "It's Adrian, isn't it? He's been so supportive since you left, always there, always... watching."

Or nodded grimly. "He wants you, Lucy. He always has. And he wants my career destroyed in the process."

Lucy sank into a chair, processing this betrayal. "The preliminary hearing is tomorrow. If these documents surface then..."

"Your case could be dismissed, and I'd be arrested," Or finished. "Adrian gets everything he wants—you, my downfall, and Meridian walks free."

Lucy's jaw set with determination. "Not if we stop him first."

The courthouse steps were crowded with reporters and environmental activists supporting the case against Meridian. Lucy climbed them with purpose, Or following at a distance as they'd planned. Inside, Adrian was waiting by the courtroom doors, his confident smile faltering when he spotted Lucy's resolute expression.

"Ready for the big day?" he asked, recovering quickly.

"More than ready," Lucy replied coolly. "I have some new evidence I'd like you to look at before we go in."

She led him to a private conference room where Or was waiting. Adrian's face darkened at the sight of him.

"What is he doing here?" Adrian demanded.

"Helping me understand some interesting financial documents that came into my possession," Lucy said, closing the door behind them. "Documents that show my husband taking bribes from Meridian."

Adrian's expression shifted to sympathy. "I'm sorry you had to find out this way, Lucy. I suspected something wasn't right with Or's finances, but I didn't want to be the one to tell you."

"That's funny," Or said, stepping forward, "because the IT department at the firm confirmed that these documents were created on your computer, Adrian. Three weeks ago, right before you anonymously sent them to me with a threat to drop the case."

Adrian's face paled. "That's absurd. They can't possibly trace—"

"Metadata doesn't lie," Lucy interrupted. "Nor does the security footage from the firm showing you accessing the financial database after hours. Or the recording I just made of you essentially admitting you knew about these documents before I showed them to you today."

She held up her phone, where the voice memo app was still running.

Adrian lunged for the phone, but Or stepped between them, his larger frame blocking Adrian effectively. "It's over, Adrian. The judge has already been informed of your attempted sabotage of the case."

"You can't prove anything," Adrian snarled, but his confident facade was crumbling.

"Actually, we can," Lucy said. "While you were busy trying to frame Or and seduce me, you got sloppy. The offshore account you created has your digital fingerprints all over it. The firm's cybersecurity team found the trail this morning."

Two security officers entered the room, summoned by a text from Lucy. As they escorted a protesting Adrian away, Lucy turned to Or, tears welling in her eyes.

"You were willing to sacrifice everything for me, for this case," she said softly. "You let me hate you to protect me."

Or reached for her hand tentatively. "I couldn't see another way. I'm sorry for the pain I caused you."

"We could have faced this together," Lucy said, squeezing his hand. "Promise me, no more secrets, no more noble sacrifices without talking to me first."

"I promise," Or said, pulling her into an embrace that felt like coming home. "Partners in everything, from now on."

Outside the conference room, the bailiff called their case. Hand in hand, Or and Lucy walked into the courtroom, ready to face whatever came next—together.
