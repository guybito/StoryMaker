# The Courage Talisman

Leo Winters hunched over her desk at the back of the bustling newsroom, trying to make herself as small as possible. At twenty-seven, she had been with the Chicago Tribune for three years, yet remained firmly anchored to the lifestyle section, writing fluff pieces about local bakeries and weekend festivals. It wasn't where she'd imagined herself when she graduated with honors in journalism, dreaming of hard-hitting investigative pieces and front-page bylines.

"Winters!" The booming voice of her editor, Marcus, cut through the newsroom chatter. "My office, now."

Leo's stomach clenched as she made her way across the room, feeling the eyes of her colleagues following her. She knew what they thought—that she lacked the backbone for real journalism, that she was content with safe, unchallenging assignments. The worst part was, they weren't entirely wrong.

Marcus didn't look up from his computer when she entered. "The Blackwood Industries scandal—I need someone on it."

Leo's pulse quickened. Blackwood Industries was the city's largest pharmaceutical company, recently implicated in a potential cover-up of dangerous side effects from their bestselling antidepressant. It was exactly the kind of story she'd dreamed of covering.

"I—" she began, ready to suggest one of the senior reporters.

"Everyone else is tied up," Marcus interrupted, finally looking at her. "This could be big, Winters. Don't screw it up."

Back at her desk, Leo stared at her blank screen, panic rising in her chest. The last time she'd been assigned a controversial story—an exposé on a local politician—she'd backed down at the first sign of resistance, accepting the politician's sanitized statement rather than pushing for the truth. The resulting article had been bland and toothless, earning her Marcus's disappointment and cementing her reputation as a reporter without the courage to chase a real story.

"You look like you've seen a ghost," came a voice from beside her.

Leo looked up to see Audrey Chen, the paper's star investigative reporter. At thirty-five, Audrey had built a reputation for fearless reporting and impeccable sources. She was everything Leo aspired to be but feared she never would.

"Marcus assigned me the Blackwood story," Leo admitted.

Audrey raised an eyebrow. "That's a big one. Nervous?"

"Terrified," Leo confessed. "I don't have your courage, Audrey. I freeze up when sources get defensive or when I need to ask the tough questions."

Audrey studied her for a moment, then reached into her pocket. "Wait here," she said, before disappearing to her desk across the newsroom. When she returned, she pressed something small and cool into Leo's palm.

It was a smooth stone pendant on a simple leather cord, deep blue with flecks of gold that caught the light. It looked ancient and somehow significant.

"What's this?" Leo asked, turning it over in her hand.

"My grandmother gave it to me when I started in journalism," Audrey said, her voice uncharacteristically solemn. "It's a courage talisman. She said it belonged to a war correspondent in World War II who never backed down from reporting the truth, even under enemy fire."

Leo looked up skeptically. "You don't strike me as someone who believes in lucky charms."

"I don't," Audrey smiled. "But I wore it for my first big story, and somehow, knowing it had belonged to someone brave made me braver too." She closed Leo's fingers around the pendant. "It's yours now. Maybe it'll help you find your courage."

Leo wanted to protest that she couldn't accept something so personal, but Audrey was already walking away. "The Blackwood CEO is holding a press conference at 2 PM," she called over her shoulder. "Don't be late."

---

The press conference was packed with reporters from every major outlet in the city. Leo fingered the pendant around her neck nervously as Richard Blackwood, the company's silver-haired CEO, took the podium with practiced confidence.

"Blackwood Industries has always prioritized patient safety," he began smoothly. "The allegations against our product are baseless and will be proven so in due course."

The questions began, and Leo found herself shrinking back, intimidated by the aggressive shouting of the veteran reporters. Then she felt the weight of the pendant against her chest and remembered Audrey's words. Taking a deep breath, she raised her hand.

To her surprise, Blackwood pointed to her. "Yes, the young lady in the back."

"Leo Winters, Chicago Tribune," she said, her voice steadier than she expected. "Internal documents suggest your company was aware of severe neurological side effects in clinical trials but omitted them from your FDA submission. Can you address these specific allegations?"

A flicker of surprise crossed Blackwood's face before his corporate smile returned. "I'm not familiar with the documents you're referencing. All our trial data was properly submitted."

"I have copies," Leo said, surprising herself with her boldness as she held up a folder. "They include emails from your head of research expressing concerns that were apparently ignored."

The room went silent. Blackwood's smile tightened. "This press conference is over," he announced, as his PR team quickly ushered him away.

Outside, Leo's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: "Brave questions. There's more to the story. Parking garage, level B, 8 PM tonight."

Leo stared at the message, her heart racing. Meeting an anonymous source in a deserted parking garage after dark? Every instinct told her to forward the message to a more experienced reporter. But as she touched the pendant again, she made a decision.

---

The parking garage was dimly lit and eerily quiet when Leo arrived that evening. She clutched her pepper spray in one hand and her phone in the other, ready to call for help.

"Ms. Winters," came a voice from the shadows. A middle-aged woman stepped forward, her face tense with anxiety. "I'm Dr. Eleanor Reed, former head of clinical research at Blackwood."

"You're the one who sent the warning emails," Leo realized.

Dr. Reed nodded. "They fired me when I refused to sign off on the manipulated data. But I kept copies of everything." She handed Leo a flash drive. "The side effects weren't just headaches and dizziness like they claimed. We had cases of seizures, permanent tremors, even a few suspected deaths that were classified as 'unrelated to treatment.'"

"Why are you coming forward now?" Leo asked.

"Because they're about to release a pediatric version," Dr. Reed said grimly. "I can't let them give this to children."

As they talked, Leo didn't notice the security guard approaching until he was almost upon them. "This area is closed after hours," he said gruffly, shining his flashlight in their faces.

"We were just leaving," Leo said quickly, tucking the flash drive into her pocket.

But as they walked toward the exit, Leo noticed the guard speaking urgently into his radio. Moments later, two men in suits appeared at the garage entrance.

"Dr. Reed," one called out. "Mr. Blackwood would like a word."

Dr. Reed froze. "They're Blackwood security," she whispered to Leo. "They've been following me."

Leo's instinct was to run, to hand over this dangerous story to someone more capable. But then she felt the weight of the pendant and thought of all the patients who might be harmed without this information coming to light.

"Follow my lead," she whispered to Dr. Reed, then loudly called out, "Thanks for the interview about your new research position! I'll be in touch if I have more questions."

She guided Dr. Reed toward a different exit, walking confidently as if they had nothing to hide. The men hesitated, clearly uncertain if they had the right person.

Once safely in Leo's car, Dr. Reed exhaled shakily. "They would have taken the evidence and made sure I never spoke to another reporter."

"You're safe now," Leo assured her, though her own hands were trembling on the steering wheel. "And your story will be told."

---

Over the next week, Leo worked tirelessly on the Blackwood story, digging through Dr. Reed's files, corroborating details with other sources, and building an airtight case. Each time she felt her courage wavering—when Blackwood's lawyers sent threatening letters to the Tribune, when she received anonymous phone calls warning her to drop the story—she touched the pendant and pushed forward.

The night before publication, Leo found Audrey working late at her desk.

"I wanted to thank you," Leo said, fingering the pendant. "This talisman really worked. I've never felt so brave."

Audrey smiled. "I read your draft. It's excellent work."

"I couldn't have done it without this," Leo said, starting to remove the pendant. "You should have it back now."

"Keep it," Audrey said. "But there's something you should know." She hesitated. "That story about the war correspondent? I made it up."

Leo stared at her. "What?"

"The pendant was just something I bought at a street fair when I first started here," Audrey admitted. "I saw how talented you were, but also how you held yourself back. You didn't need a magic talisman, Leo. You just needed to believe in yourself."

Leo looked down at the pendant, processing this revelation. "So all this time..."

"The courage was yours all along," Audrey said simply. "The pendant just gave you permission to use it."

The next morning, Leo's exposé on Blackwood Industries ran as the front-page headline. By afternoon, the FDA had announced an investigation, and Blackwood's stock was in freefall.

As congratulations poured in from colleagues who had previously dismissed her, Leo sat quietly at her desk, turning the pendant over in her hands. It wasn't magical after all, just a pretty stone on a string. Yet it had changed everything.

Marcus stopped by her desk, a rare smile on his face. "Impressive work, Winters. I've got another lead for you—potential safety violations at that new nuclear plant upstate. Interested?"

A month ago, such an assignment would have terrified her. Now, Leo nodded confidently. "Absolutely."

As Marcus walked away, Leo slipped the pendant into her desk drawer. She wouldn't be needing it anymore. The courage had been hers all along; she had simply needed to find it. And now that she had, there was no story too daunting, no truth she wasn't brave enough to pursue.

She opened a new document and began to type, ready for whatever challenge came next.
