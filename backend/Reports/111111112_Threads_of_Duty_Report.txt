## Summary Report
"Threads of Duty" is an exceptionally well-crafted historical narrative that effectively explores racial tensions in post-Reconstruction Georgia through compelling characters and escalating conflict. The story's greatest strengths lie in its character development, thematic depth, and skillful prose that creates a vivid sense of time and place. The narrative effectively balances personal and societal stakes while maintaining historical authenticity and emotional resonance. While there are minor issues with plot convenience and some background elements could be more concise, these do not significantly detract from the story's overall impact and quality.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Plot Mechanics**: The discovery of Thornton's parentage documents feels somewhat convenient. Consider establishing this discovery earlier and showing Elijah's research process to make this revelation feel more earned.

* **Character Development**: While Elijah's character is well-developed, his internal struggle could be deepened by showing more moments of doubt or conflict between his duty to the workers and his personal ambitions.

* **Narrative Pacing**: The resolution after Isaiah's revelation happens somewhat quickly. Consider expanding this section to show more of the community's reaction and the gradual transformation of attitudes rather than summarizing these changes.

* **Supporting Character Depth**: Bedford's character could be more fully developed to show his evolution from pragmatic businessman to reluctant supporter of progressive change, making his eventual acceptance of the mill project more believable.

* **Thematic Integration**: The Spanish-American War context is introduced but not fully integrated into the narrative. Either develop this historical backdrop more thoroughly or reduce its presence to maintain focus on the central conflicts.
