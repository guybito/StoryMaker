## Summary Report
"The Weight of Legacy" presents a compelling ethical dilemma through well-developed characters with clear motivations and fears. The story excels in its exploration of character transformation and moral complexity, with Logan's journey from fear to authentic courage forming a satisfying narrative arc. The prose is technically sound, though sometimes favoring explanation over vivid description. While the resolution leans toward idealism in how easily the company situation is managed, the emotional and psychological aspects of the story are handled with nuance and depth.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Strengthen the practical consequences**: The ease with which Logan navigates the company's financial issues diminishes some tension. Adding more realistic obstacles or legal complications would increase stakes and credibility.

* **Enhance visual storytelling**: Replace some explanatory passages about Logan's feelings with more sensory-rich scenes that show his internal struggle through actions, physical reactions, and environmental details.

* **Develop secondary characters further**: While the Reids serve their narrative purpose, giving them more distinctive traits beyond their role as Hunter's parents would add dimension to their forgiveness and relationship with Logan.

* **Balance the pacing**: The story's middle section could be tightened to maintain momentum, particularly in the description of Logan's investigation into Hunter's finances and his work with the company.

* **Clarify Logan's authority**: Provide more specific explanation for how Logan, as an ethics professor with no official position at Hunter's company, gains enough influence to shape the narrative and restructuring plan.
