## Short Report
"Airwaves of Vengeance" presents a compelling character study of a man consumed by past grievances who ultimately finds redemption. The story effectively uses the parallel of a literal drought ending alongside Marcus's emotional drought breaking. Character development is strong, particularly for the protagonist, with clear motivations and a satisfying character arc. The conflict is well-established and escalates appropriately, though some plot elements in the resolution could be better integrated throughout the narrative.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Foreshadow the mental illness revelation earlier** - The information about Richard's and Thomas's mental health issues feels somewhat convenient as a resolution. Introducing subtle hints earlier would make this revelation more organic and impactful.

* **Develop Eliza's character beyond her connection to Josephine** - While Eliza serves her narrative purpose well, giving her more agency and personal motivations beyond her grandmother's story would strengthen her role as more than just a catalyst for Marcus's change.

* **Integrate the drought subplot more meaningfully** - The drought works well as a metaphor, but could be more directly tied to the main conflict throughout the story, perhaps by showing how it affects the radio station's operations or the characters' decisions.

* **Provide more concrete details about the radio business** - Adding more specific details about how radio stations operate and the business aspects of WRVR would enhance authenticity and ground the conflict in more tangible stakes.

* **Balance the different perspectives on Josephine's story** - The contradictory accounts of why Josephine left could be more clearly resolved to provide a more nuanced understanding of this pivotal backstory element.
