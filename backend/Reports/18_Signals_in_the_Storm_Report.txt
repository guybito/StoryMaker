## Overall Weighted Score: 3.51

## Summary Report:
"Signals in the Storm" presents a compelling narrative with strong character development, particularly for the protagonist Marcus Thorne, whose physical and emotional vulnerabilities create a multidimensional hero. The central conflict involving corporate environmental crimes escalates effectively throughout the story, maintaining tension and reader engagement. The prose is generally clear and professional, though some scenes could benefit from more sensory detail and tighter pacing. While the plot is largely coherent, certain elements of the resolution feel somewhat convenient, slightly undermining an otherwise well-constructed narrative.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Strengthen the visual storytelling** by replacing direct statements about emotions with observable behaviors and sensory details, particularly during high-tension scenes like the federal raid and Marcus's confrontation with Eliza.

* **Develop Catherine's character more fully** across all three dimensions (physical, psychological, sociological) to make her more than just the object of Marcus's protection and give readers a stronger emotional investment in her fate.

* **Add more specific details about Northstar's environmental crimes** and the evidence Catherine discovered to increase the story's verisimilitude and strengthen the logical foundation of the conflict.

* **Revise the climactic confrontation at Northstar** to make Eliza's revelation less theatrical and Marcus's infiltration of the facility more challenging, which would increase tension and credibility.

* **Clarify the mechanics of the federal investigation** to address potential plot holes regarding how they operated without local authorities becoming aware, perhaps by introducing subtle hints earlier in the narrative.
