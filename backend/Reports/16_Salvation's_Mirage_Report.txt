## Overall Weighted Score: 3.28

## Report:
"Salvation's Mirage" presents a compelling psychological narrative with a strong protagonist whose delusions create an effective dual-layer story structure. The twist revealing Marcus's mental illness recontextualizes the narrative in a meaningful way that deepens the themes of perception versus reality. The story excels in character development and conflict escalation, with particularly strong writing craft, though some logical elements surrounding the transition between delusion and reality could be strengthened for greater clarity and cohesion.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Strengthen the reality framework**: Provide more concrete details about Marcus's actual circumstances earlier in the narrative to create subtle clues for readers before the reveal. This would make the twist feel more earned and less abrupt.

* **Develop the cult backstory**: Expanding on Marcus's specific experiences in the cult would strengthen the connection between his past trauma and current delusions, making his psychological state more comprehensible to readers.

* **Clarify the physical setting**: Be more explicit about whether Marcus is physically in a hospital throughout the story, as the transition from the prison setting to hospital room creates some spatial confusion that could be addressed with subtle environmental details.

* **Address loose narrative threads**: Provide more resolution regarding Elena's professional role and how it intersects with Marcus's treatment, as well as clearer information about the duration and pattern of Marcus's episodes to give readers a more complete understanding of his condition.
