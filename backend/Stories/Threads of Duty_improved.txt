# *Threads of Duty*

The summer heat in Dixie was unforgiving, pressing down on Elijah Harmon's shoulders as he surveyed the cotton fields stretching before him. At thirty-five, Elijah had spent nearly half his life as foreman of Willow Creek Plantation, his dark skin weathered by years under the Southern sun. The Civil War had ended decades ago, but in 1890s Georgia, freedom remained a complicated concept, especially for a Black man in his position.

Elijah adjusted his worn hat, tasting the bitter tang of dust in the air as cicadas droned in the nearby pines. The workers' hoes clinked rhythmically against stones as they moved through the fields, their backs bent beneath the merciless sun. His position was precarious—respected by the white landowners for his efficiency, resented by some for his authority, and viewed with mixed feelings by the Black workers he supervised.

He'd earned this role through an unlikely path. After emancipation, Elijah had been one of the few freed men who could read and write, taught secretly by his mother who had worked in the plantation house. When the previous owner, Thomas Calloway, needed someone who could manage accounts after the war left him short-handed, Elijah had stepped forward. His intelligence and unfailing memory for details had gradually earned him greater responsibility, though each promotion came with its own burden.

"Mr. Harmon," a soft voice called from behind him. "I've finished the sample patterns you asked for."

Turning, Elijah's stern expression softened at the sight of Sarah Calloway. At twenty-eight, Sarah was the plantation's master weaver, her slender fingers capable of transforming raw cotton into the finest fabrics that fetched premium prices in Atlanta and beyond. Her light brown hair was pulled back in a practical bun, though a few strands had escaped in the humidity, framing a face that held both gentleness and determination.

"Thank you, Miss Calloway," he replied formally, though they had known each other for years. As the daughter of the previous plantation owner and now the cousin-by-marriage to the current one, Sarah occupied an unusual position. Her father's death had left her nearly destitute, forcing her to use her weaving skills for survival rather than mere accomplishment.

What few knew was that Sarah and Elijah had formed an unlikely alliance. Together, they had developed a plan to establish a cooperative mill where freed slaves and poor whites could work together, sharing profits more equitably than the exploitative sharecropping system that had replaced slavery. Their vision was revolutionary for the time and place—perhaps dangerously so.

"The merchants in Savannah are very interested," Sarah said quietly, handing him the fabric samples. The cotton felt cool against his calloused fingers, the intricate patterns revealing Sarah's exceptional skill. "If we can secure the funding by harvest, we could break ground on the mill before winter."

Elijah nodded, carefully tucking the samples into his jacket. Their fingers brushed momentarily, a touch that lingered a second too long. The unspoken feelings between them were yet another complication in an already complex situation—a Black foreman and a white woman in the post-Reconstruction South could not openly acknowledge such sentiments.

"We'll need to be careful," Elijah warned. "Reverend Thornton has been stirring up trouble again."

The mention of the firebrand preacher made Sarah's expression tighten. Reverend Josiah Thornton had arrived in the county a year earlier, establishing a church that preached a toxic blend of religious fervor and racial hatred. His sermons increasingly targeted any cooperation between races as "ungodly mixing" and called for a return to stricter segregation.

"He's organizing a revival meeting next Sunday," Sarah confirmed. "My cousin's wife is quite taken with his preaching."

What made Thornton particularly dangerous was his ability to frame his bigotry as patriotic duty. With the Spanish-American War brewing, he had begun equating racial purity with American strength, claiming that "race-mixing" would weaken the nation in its time of need. Many young men, eager to prove their patriotism, had fallen under his sway.

Among them was Sarah's nephew, James Calloway, the sixteen-year-old son of her late brother. James had once been close to both Sarah and Elijah, the latter having taught the boy how to fish and hunt. But adolescence and Thornton's influence had transformed him into a hostile stranger who now openly opposed his aunt's friendship with Elijah.

"James came to the weaving shed yesterday," Sarah said, lowering her voice. "He said I was betraying my father's memory by working with you. He threatened to tell Reverend Thornton about our plans for the mill."

Elijah's jaw tightened. "Did he mention the account books?"

Sarah nodded grimly. The account books were their greatest vulnerability. To fund their mill project, they had been implementing a careful scheme. As plantation foreman, Elijah managed all financial transactions, recording cotton sales and expenses. For the past two years, he had been documenting slightly lower yields than actually produced, setting aside the surplus cotton. Sarah would weave this extra cotton into high-quality fabrics, which they sold through a trusted merchant in Savannah who believed he was handling Sarah's personal work. The proceeds went into a separate account under the name of Sarah's deceased aunt.

"We need to move faster," Elijah decided. "The war fever is making Thornton bolder. If we wait until harvest, it may be too late."

Their conversation was interrupted by the approach of riders. Elijah and Sarah quickly stepped apart as three men on horseback approached—Reverend Thornton himself, flanked by two of his most devoted followers. The preacher was a tall, imposing figure with a neatly trimmed beard and eyes that burned with zealous conviction.

"Miss Calloway," Thornton greeted Sarah with exaggerated courtesy, ignoring Elijah completely. "I've come to speak with your cousin about a matter of community importance."

"Mr. Bedford is in town today," Sarah replied coolly.

"Then perhaps you might relay our message," Thornton continued. "We're organizing a boycott of any businesses that employ coloreds in positions above their station." His eyes flicked dismissively toward Elijah. "Including plantations with... inappropriate management arrangements."

The threat was unmistakable. Without waiting for a response, Thornton tipped his hat to Sarah and rode toward the main house, his companions following. The air seemed to thicken with the scent of impending trouble, as tangible as the approaching thunderheads on the horizon.

"A boycott would ruin Bedford," Elijah said quietly once they were alone again. "He's leveraged to the hilt with the bank. If he can't sell this year's crop..."

"He'd have to sell the plantation," Sarah finished. "And any new owner would certainly replace you."

The stakes had just risen dramatically. Their mill project wasn't just about creating opportunity anymore—it was about survival.

Over the following weeks, tension in the county escalated. Thornton's boycott gained traction, with several merchants refusing to handle cotton from Willow Creek. Meanwhile, James had begun following Sarah and reporting her movements to Thornton. The boy's hostility had taken on a frightening edge, his adolescent confusion channeled into righteous anger.

Elijah faced mounting pressure as well. Several workers, fearing association with him would mark them as targets, began to distance themselves. Others, who had secretly supported the mill project, now wavered in their commitment.

The situation reached a breaking point when Elijah discovered something unexpected while reviewing old property records for their mill site. Buried in the yellowed pages was evidence that Reverend Thornton's father—a man the preacher claimed had been a Confederate hero—had actually been a Northern carpetbagger who had exploited freed slaves after the war. More shocking still, there were indications that Thornton himself was the son of a Black woman, his paternity concealed to protect his father's reputation.

"This would destroy him," Sarah whispered when Elijah showed her the documents in the dim light of the weaving shed. The air was heavy with the scent of cotton and dye, the wooden looms casting long shadows in the lantern light. "His entire identity is built on racial purity."

"We could use this," Elijah suggested, the desperation of their situation pushing him toward a moral compromise he would once have rejected. His fingers trembled slightly as he refolded the documents, the weight of the decision pressing on him.

Sarah looked troubled. "Blackmail, Elijah? Is that who we are now?"

Before they could resolve this ethical dilemma, disaster struck. James, who had been eavesdropping outside the shed's window, stole the documents and brought them to Thornton. The preacher, enraged by this threat to his carefully constructed identity, gathered a group of followers and rode for Willow Creek, intent on silencing Elijah permanently.

Word reached the plantation just before dusk. One of the field hands, loyal to Elijah, ran to warn him that armed men were approaching. "They're saying you're stirring up trouble, Mr. Harmon. Reverend's telling folks you're planning an uprising."

Elijah knew immediately what had happened. "Where's Miss Calloway?"

"At the main house, I think. Mr. Bedford's returned from town."

Elijah raced toward the plantation house, hoping to warn Sarah and possibly seek protection from Bedford, who, whatever his faults, was a pragmatic businessman who valued Elijah's management skills. But as he approached, he saw Thornton's group already arriving, with James riding proudly alongside the preacher.

Hiding in the shadows of the garden, Elijah watched in horror as Thornton confronted Bedford on the front porch, brandishing the documents about his father. The scent of jasmine from the garden mingled with the metallic smell of approaching rain, while torches flickered ominously in the gathering darkness.

"This nigger foreman of yours has been spreading lies about my family," Thornton raged. "He's turned the Calloway woman against her own kind and is planning some kind of mixed-race business that'll bring ruin to decent white folks."

Bedford, a thin man with calculating eyes, seemed unmoved. "Reverend, I run a business, not a church. Harmon makes me money."

"Not anymore," Thornton countered. "Not with our boycott. And there's more at stake than money. This is about our way of life, about the purity of our race when our nation needs strength."

The standoff might have continued, but James suddenly pointed toward the garden. "There he is! I see Harmon hiding there!"

Several men turned, raising their rifles. Elijah knew he should run, but his feet seemed rooted to the spot. In that moment, he saw his entire life—the careful compromises, the deferred dreams, the unspoken love—flash before him. He had always known it might end this way, a Black man who had reached too high, struck down for his ambition.

Then, a carriage came barreling up the drive, nearly colliding with the gathered horses. This wasn't mere coincidence—Elijah recognized the vehicle as belonging to Jeremiah Wilson, a free Black shopkeeper from town who had been helping them gather information about Thornton for months. Wilson had mentioned an elderly man who had been asking questions about the reverend, but Elijah hadn't expected anything to come of it so quickly.

The carriage door flew open, and out stepped an elderly Black man in a well-worn but dignified suit, leaning heavily on a cane. Despite his age, his eyes were sharp and determined.

"What in God's name is happening here?" the man demanded, his voice carrying the unmistakable authority of advanced age and absolute certainty.

The interruption created just enough confusion for Elijah to slip away from his exposed position and circle around to the back of the house. From there, he could hear the conversation continuing.

"This doesn't concern you, old man," Thornton said dismissively.

"I believe it does, Josiah," the elderly man replied, using the preacher's first name with familiar ease. "Especially when you're about to lynch a man over the very secret I've come to reveal."

A hush fell over the gathering. Even from his hiding place, Elijah could feel the shift in atmosphere.

"Who are you?" Bedford demanded.

"My name is Isaiah Johnson," the old man announced. "And I've come from Alabama to find my son, Josiah, born to me and a white woman named Elizabeth Thornton some fifty years ago."

The revelation hit like a thunderclap. Thornton's face drained of color as the old man continued, his voice gaining strength.

"I was her father's house slave. We loved each other, but when she got with child, they sent her away. When she returned, she claimed the baby had died. It was only on her deathbed last month that she told me the truth—that our son had been raised as white, taking her family name."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Thornton's followers looked to him in confusion, while James appeared stricken, his worldview crumbling before his eyes.

Seizing the moment of distraction, Elijah emerged from his hiding place and stepped forward, positioning himself between the armed men and the house where Sarah now stood in the doorway. The weight of years of caution fell away as he stood tall, no longer willing to hide.

"Gentlemen," Elijah said, his voice steady despite his racing heart, "it seems we all have some reflecting to do on who we truly are and what truly matters in this life."

The standoff lasted several tense moments before Thornton, his authority shattered, turned and rode away alone. His followers, uncertain what to believe, gradually dispersed, leaving Bedford, Sarah, Elijah, James, and the elderly Isaiah Johnson on the porch as the first heavy raindrops began to fall.

Later that evening, after the storm had passed, Elijah sat with Isaiah Johnson in the small cabin that served as the foreman's quarters. The old man explained how he had been searching for his son for years, following rumors and scraps of information. When he'd heard about a firebrand preacher in Georgia who matched his son's description and age, he had come to investigate, eventually connecting with Jeremiah Wilson, who had recognized the potential importance of Isaiah's story.

"I never expected to find him preaching such hatred," Isaiah said, his weathered hands trembling slightly as he accepted a cup of coffee. "The very thing that flows in his own veins."

In the weeks that followed, the county experienced a quiet transformation. Thornton left town, unable to face the community after his heritage was revealed. The boycott collapsed without his leadership. Isaiah Johnson, having found his long-lost son only to lose him again to pride, accepted Sarah and Elijah's invitation to stay at Willow Creek, where his knowledge of carpentry proved valuable as they began planning the mill's construction.

Most surprisingly, James, his certainties shaken to the core, began a painful process of questioning everything he had been taught. His relationship with his aunt and Elijah remained strained, but the hostility had been replaced by a wary curiosity. One afternoon, Elijah found the boy examining the architectural plans for the mill.

"How would it actually work?" James asked, not meeting Elijah's eyes. "People sharing the profits, I mean."

Elijah explained their vision: workers would own shares in the enterprise based on their labor contribution, with profits distributed accordingly rather than flowing primarily to absent owners. Management decisions would be made by an elected committee representing both Black and white workers.

"My father—your grandfather—believed the old ways were the only ways," Elijah told him. "But there are other possibilities if we're brave enough to imagine them."

As for Sarah and Elijah, they proceeded with their mill project, now with Bedford's reluctant blessing—he had recognized which way the winds were blowing and decided to position himself accordingly. With the threat of boycott removed, they no longer needed to divert plantation funds, instead securing legitimate investment from several progressive Northern businessmen whom Sarah's father had known before the war.

Their personal relationship remained necessarily discreet, but in the privacy of the weaving shed, where the rhythmic clack of the loom provided cover for their conversations, their hands now met without hesitation.

"The foundation will be laid next week," Sarah said one evening as they reviewed the final architectural plans for the mill. The lamplight caught the golden threads in the fabric sample she was holding, creating a warm glow that matched the hope in her eyes. "Bedford has agreed to sell us the riverside parcel at a fair price."

"And three families from the Simmons plantation have asked to join us," Elijah added. "Two Black, one white."

Sarah's fingers intertwined with his. "Do you think it can work?" she asked. "Not just the business, but everything else—people working together, living together, seeing each other as equals?"

Elijah looked out the window at the twilight settling over the fields where generations had toiled under oppression. The first stars were appearing in the darkening sky, points of light in the gathering darkness. "It won't be easy," he admitted. "There will always be those who preach division. But today, we choose a different path."

Outside, Isaiah Johnson sat on the porch with young James, teaching the boy to whittle—one small thread in a new fabric they were all learning to weave together. The sweet scent of pine shavings curled around them as the wood took shape beneath their hands, transforming into something new and unexpected, just as the community around them was slowly beginning to change.
