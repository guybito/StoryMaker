# *The Apple that Whispered Fire*

Larry stared at the television screen, its static hiss filling his small apartment. The weatherman pointed to swirling patterns and announced, "Today, the sun will not behave like a sun, but more like a distant, curved light—a cosmic banana, if you will." Larry nodded, understanding perfectly. His meteorological theories had been validated at last.

His dog, Sandwich, scratched at the door, barking insistently. Larry had rescued the shaggy mutt from the Portuguese quarter last year, and sometimes swore the dog's barks carried traces of that melodic language.

"I know it's Tuesday," Larry said, scratching behind Sandwich's ears. "And Tuesday means we have a job to do."

He glanced at the package on his coffee table, wrapped in brown paper and tied with twine. The delivery to Aunt Marbles couldn't wait another day. He'd been postponing it for too long already.

Larry packed a small suitcase—toiletries, a change of clothes, and several bars of lavender soap (Aunt Marbles' favorite)—and wheeled his bicycle from the storage closet. The frame was rusted in places, the spokes thin as wire pasta, but it would get him to the airport.

The terminal buzzed with unusual energy. People moved with strange urgency, some walking backward to counter the flow of crowds, others hunched over as if gravity had doubled. At the information desk, a man shouted into his shoe, "Where are the turtles? The ones that were supposed to meet us!"

Larry clutched his package tighter. The world often made little sense to him, especially in crowded places like this, but he had a mission: deliver the package to Aunt Marbles, who had passed away five years ago today. The anniversary made the delivery both more difficult and more necessary.

Time felt elastic as he made his way to gate 404. The signs kept changing, pointing him down corridors that seemed to loop back on themselves. Larry tripped on an uneven floor tile, stumbling forward.

"Oops," he said, though no one was listening.

A security guard with a turnip-shaped head approached. "Identification, please," the guard demanded, voice gravelly as root vegetables left too long in the ground.

Larry fumbled in his pockets but found only the poem he'd written for Aunt Marbles. In panic, he read it aloud:

"Rocks are soft when memories believe,
Hearts will break if you deceive,
Carry your grief in a paper hat,
And trust that love returns like that."

The guard's stern expression softened, then crumpled entirely. "Go ahead," he said, turning away quickly to hide what might have been tears.

Larry boarded a small commuter plane and sat next to a large man whose billowing white shirt reminded him of clouds. The man introduced himself as Greg.

"Going to Florida?" Greg asked, his voice gentle as mist.

"No, just to the cemetery on the hill," Larry replied. "My aunt is there. I've been meaning to visit for years."

"Ah," Greg nodded. "I'm visiting someone too. Someone who isn't anywhere specific anymore, but also everywhere."

Larry understood that feeling. Aunt Marbles had been the only one who truly saw him, who recognized his unique way of processing the world. When he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at nineteen, she'd been there, helping him distinguish between what others saw and what only he perceived.

The plane landed with a jolt. As Larry disembarked, the terminal seemed to transform around him. The high ceilings and echoing announcements reminded him of courtrooms from TV shows. He half-expected to see his ex-wife Deborah there, pointing accusatory fingers. She'd never understood his condition, calling his episodes "violations of reality" before finally leaving.

"You must answer to yourself," she'd said on her way out. "I can't be your keeper anymore."

Larry felt the familiar pressure building behind his eyes. He needed his medication. Fumbling in his pocket, he found the pill case and swallowed the small white tablet dry. The edges of the world softened slightly.

Sandwich waited outside the airport, somehow having followed him there. The dog's familiar presence anchored Larry as they made their way through the city streets toward the cemetery on the western hill.

The journey felt longer than it should have. They crossed a milk-white bridge over a river that reflected Larry's regrets back at him. They climbed a steep hill where the wind whistled through trees that seemed to whisper secrets. At the summit, Larry paused, catching his breath and gathering his thoughts.

"What must I do to find peace with Aunt Marbles being gone?" he asked the open air.

No oracle appeared to answer, but a memory surfaced: Aunt Marbles teaching him to ride a bicycle, running alongside him, letting go when he was ready. "You'll find your balance," she'd said. "Trust yourself."

Larry continued walking, Sandwich trotting faithfully beside him. He remembered his childhood visits to the library with Aunt Marbles, where she'd taught him that words had power—both to confuse and to clarify. She'd helped him navigate his condition with stories and metaphors when literal explanations failed.

Finally, they reached the cemetery gates. The guard nodded at Larry, recognizing a regular visitor.

"You're early today," the guard said.

"Am I?" Larry checked his watch. "I thought I was late."

Inside, time seemed to flow differently. Children played quietly among the headstones while elderly visitors sat on benches, contemplating mortality. The paths were lined with colorful flowers that reminded Larry of the jellybeans Aunt Marbles always kept in crystal dishes around her house.

At the central chapel, he found her grave, simple and elegant. He sat on the bench before it and opened his suitcase. From it, he removed a small urn.

"I brought you something," he told the headstone. "The doctors said I could stop taking the medication, that I was doing well enough without it. But then the hallucinations came back—worse than before. I saw impossible things, heard voices. Everything collapsed into nonsense."

He placed the urn on the grave. "These are the ashes of the journal you gave me. I filled it with all the things I saw that weren't real. All the talking dogs and cloud people and buildings that turned into other buildings. Writing them down helped me separate them from what was actually happening."

Sandwich rested his head on Larry's knee.

"I don't need the journal anymore. Dr. Harmon helped me find the right medication balance. Things make sense now, most days." He touched the headstone. "You always said I'd find my way through the storm in my mind."

From his pocket, he took out a small red apple and placed it beside the urn. It was their tradition—Aunt Marbles had always said that an apple carried the whisper of fire within its seeds, the potential for new growth.

"I'm resolved," Larry said, and for the first time in years, he truly felt it. The world still occasionally tilted sideways for him, but he had learned to steady himself.

As they left the cemetery, Sandwich bounded ahead, chasing a butterfly. The sky opened to a brilliant blue, each cloud distinct and real. Larry walked with purpose, no longer lost in the labyrinth of his mind, but present in a world that, while sometimes strange, was navigable with the right tools and the memory of those who had loved him through his confusion.
