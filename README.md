# 📖 StoryMaker

**StoryMaker** is an automated story generation system that uses AI to create long-form narratives based on plot logic or skeleton prompts. It also supports automatic literary critique, iterative improvements, and generates clean HTML outputs for easy reading.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Two plot generation algorithms**:
  - `Plotto`: Rule-based plot generation using recursive conflict resolution and character logic.
  - `PlotGenie`: Prompt-based skeleton generation expanded via AI.
- **Story creation** with adjustable length (word count).
- **Literary evaluation** using Claude 3.7.
- **Automated story improvement** based on critique feedback.
- **HTML export** for visually formatted story output and reports.

## 🧠 Usage

You can run the main script with different configurations:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or edit the bottom of `main.py` to select generation options:

```python
mainFlow("Plotto", stories_amount=1, words_in_story_amount=100, improve=False, create_html=True)
mainFlow("PlotGenie", stories_amount=1, words_in_story_amount=100, improve=False, create_html=True)
```

### Parameters

- `algorithm_type`: `"Plotto"` or `"PlotGenie"`
- `stories_amount`: Number of stories to generate
- `words_in_story_amount`: Approximate length per story
- `improve`: Whether to apply literary improvements
- `create_html`: Whether to generate `.html` versions of outputs

---

## 🧪 Output Files

For each story, the following files are generated:

- `.txt`: Raw story content
- `.txt`: Literary critique report
- `_improved.txt`: (Optional) Improved version of the story
- `.html`: (Optional) HTML version of the story and report
