Write a story of approximately 500 words.
Give the story an appropriate, compelling title.
Write the entire story in clear, modern English. Avoid archaic expressions.
The story is based on the following plot skeleton:
In this story set at a regatta, our hero is a florist who falls in love with a triplet...
Their goal is blocked by a major problem: desired vengeance against an insulter opposed by physical weakness..
However, love does not come easy because beloved is in fear of a jealous rival.
Things become more tangled when an illicit love affair or adultery threatens loss of liberty,
and matters worsen as sacrifice to passion, habit or mania threatens loss of love.
At the height of tension, a crisis hits: loss of sight, hearing, or other senses of a loved one is threatened.
The story climaxes in a twist where in which the captor proves to be a friend who is rescuing the hero from a greater catastrophe
