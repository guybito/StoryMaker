Plot Genie - Fiction Plot Generator

This module implements a class `PlotGenie` that generates random plot skeletons
based on the 1934 book "Plot Genie Index" by Wycliffe A. Hill.
It selects elements from predefined lists of story components such as locale,
characters, problems, obstacles, complications, predicaments, crises, and climaxes.

Key Features:
- Modular and extensible
- Supports reproducible randomness with seed
- Generates natural language plot summaries
- Can export plot descriptions to text files

Data source: JSON files containing the categorized plot elements.
