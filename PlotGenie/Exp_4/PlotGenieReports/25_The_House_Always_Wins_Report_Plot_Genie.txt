## Overall Weighted Score: 3.35

## Brief Report:
"The House Always Wins" presents a well-structured crime narrative with clear character motivations and a compelling central conflict. The story effectively builds tension through escalating stakes and delivers a satisfying twist with Harrington's betrayal. The prose is clean and accessible, though some aspects of the investigation strain credibility. The character development, particularly Alex's journey from loyalty to disillusionment to renewal, forms the emotional core of the story.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Deepen character backstories**: Provide more specific details about Alex's past to strengthen reader connection and explain his intense loyalty to Harrington. This would make the betrayal even more impactful.

* **Increase investigation challenges**: Make the process of gathering evidence more difficult and dangerous to enhance believability and tension. Amateur investigators shouldn't too easily uncover professional criminal operations.

* **Develop the relationship between Sophia and the police**: Clarify earlier how and why Sophia connected with law enforcement to make this revelation feel more organic rather than convenient.

* **Add more sensory details**: Enhance the casino atmosphere with more specific sensory elements (sounds, smells, tactile sensations) to create a more immersive reading experience.

* **Expand on Harrington's character**: Provide more hints of Harrington's duplicity earlier in the narrative to make the revelation feel earned rather than sudden, perhaps through subtle inconsistencies in his behavior that Alex initially dismisses.
