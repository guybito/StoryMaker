## Critical Assessment
"Masks of Vengeance" is a well-crafted narrative that skillfully balances character development with plot progression. The story excels in establishing a compelling protagonist with clear motivations and a satisfying character arc. The New Orleans Mardi Gras setting provides a thematically resonant backdrop of masks and hidden identities that enhances the central conflict. The prose is polished and descriptive without becoming purple or overwrought. While the resolution relies somewhat on coincidence, the thematic exploration of justice versus revenge provides sufficient depth to overcome this minor weakness.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
* **Develop Dr. Mercer's introduction more organically** - His appearance with exactly the right evidence at precisely the right moment feels too convenient. Consider foreshadowing his presence earlier or creating a more plausible reason for their paths crossing.
  
* **Deepen the exploration of consequences** - While Marcus's internal transformation is well-handled, the story could benefit from more consideration of what happens after the evidence is presented. This would strengthen the resolution and provide more closure.
  
* **Enhance Elise's characterization** - Though effective as an antagonist, Elise remains somewhat one-dimensional. Even without her physical presence in the story, providing more nuanced insights into her motivations would add complexity to the conflict.
  
* **Balance the metaphysical elements** - Celeste's astrological insights walk a fine line between character quirk and actual supernatural element. Clarifying whether her predictions have genuine power or are simply coincidental would strengthen the story's internal logic.
