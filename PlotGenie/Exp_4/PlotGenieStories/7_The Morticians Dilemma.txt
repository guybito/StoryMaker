# *The Mortician's Dilemma*

The smell of formaldehyde clung to Marcus Reeves like a second skin. After twelve years working as a mortuary driller at Evergreen Memorial, he had grown accustomed to the pungent chemical scent that followed him everywhere. His job—preparing bodies for embalming by draining their blood and inserting tubes for the embalming fluid—wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills and offered a strange sort of peace that he'd never found elsewhere.

Marcus had always been more comfortable with the dead than the living. The deceased didn't judge his stutter, his awkward social mannerisms, or the burn scars that covered the left side of his face—remnants of the house fire that had claimed his parents when he was just eight years old. In the quiet of the morgue, surrounded by those who had already faced their final moments, Marcus found solace.

"Another late night, Mr. Reeves?" The night security guard nodded as Marcus swiped his badge at the entrance of Evergreen Memorial Morgue.

"J-just finishing up some p-paperwork," Marcus replied, ducking his head to avoid eye contact. He hurried down the dimly lit corridor to his small office adjacent to the preparation room.

The morgue was eerily quiet at this hour—just past midnight on a Tuesday. Most of the staff had gone home hours ago, leaving only the security guard and the occasional night shift worker. Marcus preferred it this way. The solitude allowed him to work without the discomfort of social interaction.

As he settled at his desk, his phone buzzed with a text message. It was from Eliza Chen, the night shift telephone operator at Evergreen.

*"You still here? I brought coffee. Meeting room in 5?"*

A small smile tugged at Marcus's lips. Eliza was perhaps the only person at Evergreen who made him feel at ease. She had started working the night shift six months ago, and their midnight coffee breaks had become a ritual he looked forward to.

In the small break room, Eliza was already waiting, two steaming cups of coffee on the table. At thirty-two, she was five years younger than Marcus, with intelligent eyes behind stylish glasses and a warm smile that somehow made the morgue feel less cold.

"I was beginning to think you'd stood me up," she teased, sliding a cup toward him.

"S-sorry. Got caught up in some paperwork." Marcus took the seat across from her, grateful for the coffee and the company.

Eliza worked the phones at night, coordinating with hospitals, funeral homes, and occasionally the police when bodies needed to be transported. Like Marcus, she seemed to prefer the night shift, though he had never asked why.

"Did you hear about the Donovan case?" Eliza asked, lowering her voice even though they were alone. "The police called earlier. They're bringing him in tomorrow for a second autopsy."

Marcus nodded. James Donovan had been a wealthy real estate developer whose death had initially been ruled a heart attack. But rumors had been swirling about foul play, particularly given the substantial inheritance at stake.

"His son's pushing for it," Eliza continued. "Apparently, he doesn't believe the heart attack story. Thinks his stepmother might have had something to do with it."

"The w-wife who's thirty years younger than him?" Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Can't say I'm s-surprised."

Their conversation drifted to lighter topics—a documentary Eliza had watched about deep-sea creatures, a new embalming technique Marcus was learning. In these quiet moments, Marcus could almost forget the weight of his past and the loneliness that typically shadowed him.

As their coffee break ended and they prepared to return to their respective posts, Eliza hesitated.

"Marcus, I've been meaning to ask... would you maybe want to grab dinner sometime? Outside of work, I mean."

The question caught him off guard. His heart raced, and he felt the familiar tightening in his chest that preceded his stutter worsening.

"I... I'd l-like that," he managed, surprising himself with his courage.

Eliza's smile brightened the dim room. "Great! How about Friday?"

As Marcus returned to his office, a strange mixture of excitement and anxiety swirled within him. It had been years since he'd been on a date—if that's what this was. His social isolation had become so normal that the prospect of breaking it was both thrilling and terrifying.

The next morning, Marcus was preparing to leave when Dr. Patel, the chief medical examiner, stopped him in the hallway.

"Marcus, I need you to stay for the Donovan autopsy. Detective Rivera will be here at noon, and I want everything ready."

Marcus nodded, suppressing a sigh. He had been awake for nearly twenty-four hours, but he knew better than to argue with Dr. Patel.

The Donovan autopsy was scheduled for noon, but Detective Rivera arrived early, accompanied by a woman Marcus didn't recognize.

"This is Vanessa Donovan, the deceased's wife," Rivera introduced her. "She's here to identify the body and answer any questions."

Vanessa Donovan was strikingly beautiful, with perfectly styled blonde hair and designer clothes that seemed out of place in the sterile morgue. But it was her eyes that caught Marcus's attention—cold and calculating, assessing everything around her.

As Dr. Patel began the autopsy, Marcus assisted silently, handing instruments and managing the equipment. Detective Rivera observed from a distance, occasionally making notes, while Vanessa Donovan stood rigidly by the door, her face a mask of practiced grief.

The autopsy revealed what the initial examination had missed—traces of a rare poison in Donovan's system, cleverly disguised to mimic the symptoms of a heart attack. The room grew tense as Dr. Patel explained his findings.

"This was no natural death," he concluded. "Mr. Donovan was murdered."

Detective Rivera's gaze shifted to Vanessa, whose composure remained unshaken. "Mrs. Donovan, I think we need to continue this conversation at the station."

As they left, Marcus couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. The way Vanessa had watched the autopsy—not with grief or shock, but with a calculating intensity—disturbed him.

Later that evening, as Marcus prepared to finally go home and get some sleep, Eliza called his office phone.

"Marcus, you need to come to the reception area now," her voice was urgent, lacking its usual warmth. "There's something you need to see."

In the reception area, Eliza was standing by her desk, her face pale. On her computer screen was a news article with a familiar face—Vanessa Donovan.

"I knew I recognized her," Eliza said, her voice shaking. "Five years ago, she was involved in another case—her previous husband also died under suspicious circumstances. She was never charged, but..."

Marcus read the article, a chill running down his spine. According to the piece, Vanessa—then using a different last name—had been the prime suspect in her first husband's death. The case had been dropped due to insufficient evidence.

"There's more," Eliza continued, clicking to another tab. "I did some digging. Before she married Donovan, she worked as a nurse at Mercy Hospital. Three of her elderly patients died unexpectedly. Investigations were inconclusive."

"We need to call Detective Rivera," Marcus said, his stutter momentarily forgotten in the urgency of the moment.

But before they could make the call, the morgue's security system alerted them to a breach at the back entrance. The security cameras showed a figure in dark clothing moving through the hallways—heading directly toward the evidence room where samples from Donovan's autopsy were stored.

"It's her," Eliza whispered, recognizing Vanessa's silhouette despite the disguise.

Marcus knew they needed to act quickly. If Vanessa destroyed the evidence, she would walk free—again. But confronting a potential serial killer wasn't something either of them was prepared for.

"Call security and the police," Marcus instructed Eliza. "I'll try to stall her."

"Marcus, no!" Eliza grabbed his arm. "She's dangerous."

But Marcus was already moving, driven by a determination he hadn't known he possessed. He couldn't let Vanessa escape justice again.

Using his knowledge of the morgue's layout, Marcus took a shortcut to intercept Vanessa before she reached the evidence room. He found her at the end of a dimly lit corridor, working on picking the lock to the storage area.

"You s-shouldn't be here," Marcus called out, his voice echoing in the empty hallway.

Vanessa spun around, her disguise doing little to hide her identity up close. "The night driller," she said, recognition flashing in her eyes. "Step aside. This doesn't concern you."

"I c-can't let you destroy evidence," Marcus replied, standing his ground despite the fear coursing through him.

Vanessa's expression hardened. "Do you know what it's like to be trapped? To be so close to freedom, only to have it snatched away by someone else's greed?" She took a step toward him. "James promised me everything, then changed his will to favor his ungrateful son. After everything I did for him."

"You k-killed him," Marcus stated, not a question but a confirmation.

"I liberated myself," Vanessa corrected, pulling a small knife from her pocket. "Just like I'll liberate myself from this situation."

Marcus backed up, his mind racing. He needed to keep her talking until help arrived. "Your f-first husband... and those patients at Mercy Hospital. Was that 'liberation' too?"

Surprise flickered across Vanessa's face. "You've been doing your homework. Impressive for someone who spends his days with the dead." She advanced slowly, knife glinting in the low light. "Unfortunately, that knowledge makes you a problem."

Just as Vanessa lunged forward, the morgue's fire alarm blared to life. The sudden noise startled her, giving Marcus the split second he needed to dodge her attack. Down the hall, he could see Eliza by the alarm pull station, her quick thinking creating the distraction he desperately needed.

The alarm triggered the morgue's emergency protocols—automatically alerting the fire department and police, and locking down certain areas to prevent damage to sensitive materials. Including, Marcus realized with relief, the evidence room.

Vanessa seemed to realize this too. Her calculated composure cracked, replaced by panic as she heard sirens in the distance. She turned to flee, but found her path blocked by security guards responding to the alarm.

In her desperation, Vanessa made a fatal mistake. She attempted to take Eliza hostage, not realizing that the telephone operator had already alerted not only the police but also Dr. Patel and Detective Rivera, who had been working late at the police station nearby reviewing the case.

As Vanessa threatened Eliza with the knife, Detective Rivera appeared at the end of the corridor, weapon drawn. "Drop the knife, Mrs. Donovan. It's over."

Cornered and outnumbered, Vanessa made one last desperate attempt to escape, only to be quickly subdued by the detective and security personnel.

In the aftermath, as police officers led Vanessa away and paramedics checked Marcus and Eliza for injuries, Detective Rivera approached them.

"You two may have just helped us catch a serial killer," he said, genuine respect in his voice. "The evidence she was trying to destroy, combined with what we've uncovered about her past, should be enough to put her away for a very long time."

Later, as dawn broke over the city, Marcus and Eliza sat in a twenty-four-hour diner across from the morgue, both too wired to sleep despite their exhaustion.

"Some first date this turned out to be," Eliza joked weakly, her hands still trembling slightly around her coffee cup.

Marcus surprised himself by reaching across the table to take her hand. "M-maybe we can try again? Something less... life-threatening next time."

Eliza's laugh was shaky but genuine. "I'd like that."

As they sat in the quiet diner, watching the sunrise paint the sky in shades of pink and gold, Marcus realized something had shifted within him. The walls he had built around himself for protection were beginning to crumble. In facing danger to protect others—to protect Eliza—he had found a courage he didn't know he possessed.

The morgue had always been his sanctuary because the dead couldn't hurt him. But now, for the first time in years, he was ready to risk the pain that came with living, with connecting to others. It was terrifying and exhilarating all at once.

"What are you thinking about?" Eliza asked, squeezing his hand gently.

Marcus looked at her, his stutter momentarily forgotten. "New beginnings."

Outside, the city was waking up, full of life and possibilities. And for once, Marcus was ready to join it.
