# *The House Always Wins*

Alex Mercer's nimble fingers danced across the green felt table, shuffling cards with practiced precision. At twenty-two, he was the youngest croupier at The Royal Flush, the exclusive casino nestled within Westlake University's off-campus entertainment district. His economics major provided theoretical knowledge of probability and statistics, but it was his natural talent for reading people that made him exceptional at his job.

"Nine for the gentleman in the blue suit," Alex announced, his voice carrying just enough authority to command respect without intimidation. He slid the cards across the blackjack table with a fluid motion that looked effortless but had taken months to perfect.

From across the casino floor, he caught sight of Sophia Chen, the hotel's VIP hostess, escorting a group of wealthy alumni to the high-stakes poker room. Her crimson dress complemented her confident stride as she navigated the crowded floor with grace. Their eyes met briefly, and the slight curl of her lips sent a familiar warmth through his chest.

Their relationship had begun three months ago, after a chance encounter in the employee break room. What started as casual conversation had quickly evolved into something deeper, more meaningful. But their romance carried a complication neither had anticipated when they first kissed in the dim light of the casino's garden terrace.

As his shift ended, Alex loosened his bow tie and made his way to the hotel bar where Sophia waited, nursing a gin and tonic.

"Busy night?" he asked, sliding onto the stool beside her.

"The Westlake Alumni Association is in town for their annual fundraiser," she replied, her voice carrying the slight musical lilt that Alex found endlessly charming. "Which means Mr. Donovan is making his rounds, reminding everyone how important he is."

Alex's jaw tightened at the mention of James Donovan, the owner of The Grand Exchange, the newer, flashier casino hotel that had opened across town six months ago. The Royal Flush had been struggling ever since, losing high-rollers to Donovan's establishment with its modern amenities and aggressive marketing.

"He asked about you again," Sophia said quietly, stirring her drink. "Offered to double your salary if you'd switch sides."

"I'm not interested in working for Donovan," Alex replied firmly. "The Royal Flush gave me a chance when no one else would. I don't forget loyalty."

What Alex didn't say was that his loyalty was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. The Royal Flush was falling behind, its dated décor and aging systems unable to compete with The Grand Exchange's cutting-edge technology and lavish entertainment. As a business student, he recognized the signs of a failing enterprise, but his emotional attachment to the place—and to Mr. Harrington, the owner who had hired him despite his lack of experience—kept him from jumping ship.

"There's something else," Sophia said, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Donovan knows about us."

Alex's blood ran cold. "How?"

"Someone must have told him. He implied that my relationship with you was... unprofessional. That it might affect my career prospects if I were to apply elsewhere."

The threat was thinly veiled but unmistakable. In their industry, reputation was everything. If Donovan spread rumors about Sophia mixing business with pleasure, it could damage her professional standing.

"He can't do that," Alex said, anger rising in his throat.

"He can, and he will," Sophia replied, her usual composure cracking slightly. "He's powerful, Alex. More powerful than we realized."

The following week brought more troubling news. The Royal Flush's suppliers began canceling contracts, citing "business restructuring" as their excuse. But Alex knew better. Donovan was leveraging his connections, orchestrating a subtle boycott that threatened not just the casino's operations but the livelihoods of its employees.

Mr. Harrington, once vibrant and optimistic, now moved through the casino with stooped shoulders and a perpetual frown. The staff whispered about potential layoffs, and the once-bustling gaming floor grew quieter each night.

"We need to do something," Alex told Sophia as they sat in his small apartment, takeout containers scattered across the coffee table. "Harrington gave me everything. I can't just watch Donovan destroy him."

"What can we possibly do against someone like Donovan?" Sophia asked, practical as always.

Alex leaned forward, his eyes bright with determination. "We find his weakness. Everyone has one."

Their investigation began discreetly. Sophia used her position to gather information from visiting executives, while Alex cultivated relationships with delivery personnel and maintenance workers who moved between the two establishments. Piece by piece, they assembled a picture of James Donovan's operation—and discovered something unexpected.

The Grand Exchange's meteoric success wasn't built on superior service or innovation alone. Financial records that Sophia had "borrowed" from a careless accountant revealed irregular cash flows and questionable transactions. Donovan was laundering money through his casino, using it as a front for something much darker.

"This is dangerous territory," Sophia warned as they reviewed the documents spread across Alex's kitchen table. "If Donovan finds out we know—"

"He won't," Alex assured her, though uncertainty gnawed at his confidence. "We just need enough evidence to take to the authorities."

But their amateur investigation didn't go unnoticed. One evening, as Alex dealt cards at his table, he noticed two men in expensive suits watching him from the bar. They weren't typical patrons—their eyes were too alert, their posture too rigid. When his shift ended, the men followed him to the parking lot.

"Mr. Mercer," one called, his voice gravelly and cold. "Mr. Donovan would like a word."

Alex's heart hammered against his ribs. "I'm afraid I'm busy tonight."

The second man stepped closer, his hand sliding beneath his jacket in an unmistakable gesture. "It wasn't a request."

The drive to The Grand Exchange passed in tense silence. Alex's mind raced through scenarios, each more dire than the last. Had they discovered his investigation? Was Sophia safe?

James Donovan's office occupied the top floor of the hotel, offering panoramic views of the city. The man himself sat behind an imposing desk, his silver hair perfectly styled, his tailored suit emphasizing his athletic build despite his sixty years.

"Alex Mercer," Donovan said, gesturing to a chair. "Please, sit. Can I offer you a drink?"

"I'd prefer to know why I'm here," Alex replied, remaining standing.

Donovan smiled, though it didn't reach his eyes. "Direct. I appreciate that in a young man." He leaned back in his chair. "You've been asking questions about my business. Dangerous questions."

Alex's mouth went dry, but he maintained his composure. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Don't insult my intelligence," Donovan snapped, his façade of civility cracking. "You and that girlfriend of yours have been poking around where you don't belong. I'm giving you one chance to walk away. Stop your investigation, and we'll forget this happened."

"And if I don't?"

Donovan's smile returned, colder than before. "Then Ms. Chen might find herself facing some unfortunate accusations. Theft, perhaps. Or maybe something more serious."

The threat against Sophia ignited something primal in Alex. "Stay away from her."

"That's entirely up to you," Donovan replied smoothly. "Make the right choice, and everyone stays healthy and employed."

The implied threat was clear. Alex left The Grand Exchange with his mind in turmoil, torn between protecting Sophia and his loyalty to Harrington. When he told Sophia about the encounter, her face paled.

"We need to stop," she insisted. "It's not worth risking our lives."

But Alex couldn't let go. The following night, using the key card Sophia had provided, he slipped into The Grand Exchange's administrative offices to gather final evidence of Donovan's illegal activities. He was downloading files from the computer when the office door opened.

Alex ducked behind a filing cabinet, heart pounding. Through the narrow gap, he saw Donovan enter with another man—older, with a distinguished bearing that seemed oddly familiar.

"The shipment arrives tomorrow," Donovan was saying. "Once we've processed it through the books, your cut will be transferred as usual."

"And the investigation?" the older man asked, his voice sending a jolt of recognition through Alex.

"Handled," Donovan replied confidently. "The young croupier and his girlfriend won't be a problem."

As the men moved further into the office, Alex caught a clear glimpse of Donovan's companion—and nearly gasped aloud. It was Richard Harrington, owner of The Royal Flush and the man Alex had considered a mentor and father figure.

The revelation struck like a physical blow. Harrington wasn't a victim of Donovan's business tactics; he was a partner in whatever illegal operation they were running. The boycott, the competition—it was all a elaborate façade.

In his shock, Alex knocked over a stapler. The noise, though small, echoed in the quiet office.

"What was that?" Donovan demanded, reaching into his desk drawer and pulling out a gun.

Alex froze, trapped. As footsteps approached his hiding place, he gripped a heavy paperweight, preparing to defend himself. When Donovan rounded the corner, Alex swung without hesitation, aiming for the arm holding the weapon.

Donovan deflected the blow and lunged forward. They grappled briefly before Alex managed to knock the gun away. It skittered across the floor, stopping at Harrington's feet.

"Richard, shoot him!" Donovan shouted.

Harrington picked up the gun with trembling hands, pointing it at Alex. "I'm sorry, son. You shouldn't have gotten involved."

"You were like a father to me," Alex said, disbelief and betrayal washing over him. "I trusted you."

Something flickered in Harrington's eyes—regret, perhaps, or shame. His hand wavered.

"Shoot him!" Donovan demanded again.

In that moment of hesitation, the office door burst open. Police officers flooded the room, weapons drawn.

"Police! Everyone on the ground!"

In the chaos that followed, Alex learned the truth. Sophia, fearing for his safety, had contacted the authorities with the evidence they'd already gathered. She'd been working with an undercover officer for weeks, building a case against both Donovan and Harrington.

"I couldn't let you risk your life," she explained later at the police station, her eyes pleading for understanding. "When you told me about Donovan's threats, I knew it had gone too far."

The investigation revealed the full extent of the operation. Donovan and Harrington had been partners for years, using their casinos to launder money for a drug trafficking ring. The staged rivalry between their establishments was designed to distract from their collaboration.

Most shocking was the discovery that Harrington had faked his brother's death years earlier—a brother who had threatened to expose their illegal activities. The supposedly deceased sibling had been living under an assumed identity, managing offshore accounts for the operation.

In the aftermath, The Royal Flush was placed under new management. Alex, recognized for his unwitting role in bringing down the criminal enterprise, was offered a position as floor manager—a significant promotion that recognized both his skills and integrity.

On their first night back at work, Alex found Sophia waiting by his usual blackjack table, a smile playing on her lips.

"Ready to start fresh?" she asked, taking his hand.

Alex squeezed her fingers gently, looking around at the casino that had been both the setting of his greatest betrayal and his most important victory.

"You know what they say in this business," he replied with a small smile. "The house always wins. But this time, I think we're the house."

As they walked together across the gaming floor, Alex realized that some bets were worth taking, even against impossible odds. In gambling and in life, sometimes you had to risk everything to win what truly mattered.
