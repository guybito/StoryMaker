# *The Lancer's Oath*

The morning sun cast a golden glow over Château Bellevue, its limestone walls gleaming against the backdrop of the French countryside. Inside, Jean-Michel Renault stood at the window of his quarters, his tall, lean frame silhouetted against the light. At thirty-five, he carried himself with the disciplined posture of a man who had spent his life in service. His weathered hands, calloused from years of wielding a lance in the prestigious Cavalry Regiment of the French Army, now rested on the windowsill as he contemplated the journey ahead.

Jean-Michel was not merely a soldier; he was one of the last true lancers in modern military history, part of an elite ceremonial unit that preserved the ancient traditions of mounted combat. The irony wasn't lost on him that he now faced a battle far more complex than any he had trained for.

"You're brooding again," came a sultry voice from behind him.

He turned to see Camille Dubois leaning against the doorframe, her dark hair cascading over one shoulder. At twenty-nine, she possessed a magnetic presence that had served her well as a hostess at Le Papillon Noir, one of Paris's most exclusive nightclubs.

"Planning," Jean-Michel corrected with a half-smile. "There's a difference."

Camille crossed the room, the silk of her robe whispering with each step. "Your sister's been missing for three months. If your uncle knows something, as you suspect, we need to move quickly."

Jean-Michel nodded grimly. His younger sister, Elise, had disappeared while investigating their uncle's business dealings. Henri Renault, their father's brother, had transformed from a struggling vineyard owner to a wealthy businessman in just two years—a transformation that Elise, an investigative journalist, had found suspicious.

"The private investigator confirmed it," Jean-Michel said. "Uncle Henri has been laundering money for the Corsican syndicate. Elise must have discovered proof."

"And now we must find her before it's too late," Camille said, placing a hand on his arm. Their relationship had begun six months ago when Jean-Michel frequented Le Papillon Noir during his leave. What started as casual conversation had deepened into something neither had expected—a partnership that now transcended romance.

"Henri's hosting a charity gala at his estate in Corsica tomorrow night," Jean-Michel said. "It's our chance to search his office, find evidence of Elise's whereabouts, and expose his operation."

"There's just one problem," Camille reminded him. "All flights to Corsica have been canceled due to the approaching storm."

Jean-Michel's jaw tightened. "Then we charter a private plane. We can't wait."

"That's suicide, Jean," Camille argued. "The weather reports are calling it the worst storm in decades."

"Every day we delay puts Elise in more danger," he countered. "I've already contacted an old army friend who owns a small aircraft. He's willing to attempt the flight—for a price."

Camille sighed, knowing that arguing was futile. Jean-Michel's loyalty to his sister was unshakable. It was one of the qualities that had drawn her to him, even as it now threatened to lead them into peril.

"Then I'm coming with you," she said firmly.

"Camille, you don't have to—"

"I know Henri's world better than you do," she interrupted. "The wealthy patrons, the social codes. You need me."

What she didn't say was how much she needed this too—a chance to prove herself beyond the glittering façade of nightclub life, to be more than what her strict Catholic family had labeled her: a fallen woman who had chosen a sinful profession.

The small aircraft bucked violently as it cut through the storm clouds. Rain lashed against the windows, and lightning illuminated the cabin in brief, harsh flashes. Jean-Michel gripped the armrests, his knuckles white. Beside him, Camille maintained a composed expression, though her pale complexion betrayed her fear.

"Ten minutes to landing," the pilot shouted over the roar of the engines and thunder. "It's going to be rough."

Jean-Michel nodded, his thoughts turning to the mission ahead. Henri's estate, Villa Paradiso, was perched on a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean. The charity gala would provide the perfect cover for them to infiltrate his private study.

The plane dropped suddenly, eliciting a gasp from Camille. Jean-Michel reached for her hand, squeezing it reassuringly.

"We'll make it," he promised.

As the aircraft descended toward the small private airstrip, Jean-Michel reflected on the stakes. His uncle's ambition had always been legendary within the family. Henri had resented living in the shadow of Jean-Michel's father, the respected vineyard owner who had inherited the family business. When his father died five years ago, leaving the vineyard to Jean-Michel and Elise, Henri's bitterness had calcified into something darker.

The plane touched down with a jarring thud, skidding slightly on the rain-slicked runway before coming to a stop. Jean-Michel released a breath he hadn't realized he was holding.

"Welcome to Corsica," the pilot announced grimly. "I'll be staying with the plane. You have twenty-four hours before I need to depart, storm or no storm."

---

Villa Paradiso blazed with light, a beacon against the stormy night. Luxury vehicles lined the circular driveway as attendants with umbrellas escorted guests inside. Jean-Michel and Camille arrived in a rented car, their evening attire concealing their true purpose.

"Remember," Camille murmured as they approached the entrance, "Henri knows you, but he's never met me. I'm Isabelle Moreau, art dealer from Paris."

Jean-Michel nodded, adjusting his bow tie. "And I'm just the estranged nephew making amends."

The interior of the villa was opulent to the point of ostentation—crystal chandeliers, marble floors, and priceless artwork that Jean-Michel suspected hadn't been acquired legitimately. Waiters circulated with champagne and hors d'oeuvres as a string quartet played in the corner.

Henri Renault stood near the grand staircase, a glass of whiskey in hand. At sixty, he maintained a distinguished appearance—silver hair, tailored tuxedo, and the confident posture of a man accustomed to power. His eyes widened momentarily when he spotted Jean-Michel.

"Nephew," Henri said as they approached, his smile not reaching his eyes. "What an unexpected pleasure."

"Uncle," Jean-Michel replied with forced cordiality. "I hope you don't mind my intrusion. I've been reflecting on family lately, especially since Elise's... absence."

A flicker of something—guilt? fear?—crossed Henri's face before his mask of civility returned. "Of course. Family should stand together in difficult times." His gaze shifted to Camille. "And who is your lovely companion?"

Camille extended her hand with practiced grace. "Isabelle Moreau. Jean-Michel and I met at an exhibition in Paris."

Henri kissed her hand, his eyes appraising her with unsettling intensity. "Enchanted, mademoiselle. Please, enjoy the gala. We're raising funds for marine conservation tonight."

As Henri was called away by another guest, Jean-Michel and Camille exchanged a look. The mention of marine conservation struck them both as ironic, given what they suspected about Henri's true activities.

They circulated through the crowd, Camille effortlessly charming the guests while Jean-Michel observed the security measures. Two guards stood at the base of the staircase leading to the private quarters, and he noticed cameras discreetly positioned in the corners of the room.

"The study will be upstairs," Jean-Michel whispered to Camille during a momentary lull in the music. "We need a distraction."

Camille's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Leave that to me."

Twenty minutes later, Camille was at the center of attention, regaling a group of wealthy patrons with an animated story about a fictional art heist in Montmartre. As the guards at the staircase turned to watch, Jean-Michel slipped past them and ascended to the second floor.

The hallway was dimly lit and lined with doors. Jean-Michel moved silently, testing each handle until he found one that opened into a spacious study. Bookshelves lined the walls, and a massive desk dominated the center of the room. He closed the door behind him and began his search.

The desk drawers yielded nothing of interest—business contracts, property deeds, and financial statements that appeared legitimate at first glance. Jean-Michel's frustration mounted until he noticed a slight discoloration on one of the wooden panels behind the desk. Pressing it revealed a hidden compartment containing a leather-bound ledger.

The ledger detailed transactions between Henri's import-export business and various shell companies, with coded references to shipments that Jean-Michel recognized as drug trafficking terminology from his military intelligence training. More disturbing were the notes about "cargo disposal" at sea.

A cold realization washed over him. The "marine conservation" wasn't just a cover—it was a sick joke. Henri was using his boats to dispose of evidence—possibly people—in the Mediterranean.

As Jean-Michel photographed the pages with his phone, a notation caught his eye: "E.R. containment—Villa basement, pending disposal after storm."

E.R. Elise Renault.

His blood turned to ice. His sister wasn't just missing—she was here, in this very building, awaiting execution.

The sound of the door opening made Jean-Michel whirl around. Henri stood in the doorway, a pistol in his hand.

"I always knew you were too honorable for your own good," Henri said, his voice eerily calm. "Just like your father."

Jean-Michel straightened, the ledger still in his hand. "Where is Elise?"

"Safe, for now," Henri replied. "Though I can't guarantee how long that will last, especially with this storm raising the water levels in the basement."

"The basement is flooding?" Jean-Michel's voice rose in alarm.

Henri smiled coldly. "A regrettable situation. But then, accidents happen all the time on this treacherous coastline."

"This isn't about money anymore, is it?" Jean-Michel realized. "This is about our father's legacy. You couldn't stand that he succeeded where you failed."

"Your father was a fool who squandered opportunities!" Henri spat, his composure cracking. "I've built an empire while you play soldier and Elise chases stories. Neither of you deserved the vineyard."

"So you partnered with criminals, betrayed your family, and now you're willing to let your own niece drown?" Jean-Michel's disgust was palpable.

Henri's finger tightened on the trigger. "Put down the ledger and move away from the desk."

Jean-Michel complied slowly, his military training kicking in as he assessed his options. Henri was blocking the only exit, and the pistol gave him a decisive advantage.

"Now we're going to walk downstairs together," Henri continued. "You'll make your excuses to your lovely friend, and then you'll join Elise. The storm will take care of the rest."

As Henri gestured toward the door with the gun, the lights flickered and went out, plunging the room into darkness. In that moment of confusion, Jean-Michel lunged forward, using his lancer's training to strike with precision. His fist connected with Henri's wrist, sending the gun clattering to the floor.

The two men grappled in the darkness, crashing into furniture. Despite his age, Henri fought with the desperate strength of a cornered animal. But Jean-Michel's military discipline prevailed, and he pinned his uncle to the floor just as the emergency generators kicked in, bathing the room in dim light.

"It's over, Henri," Jean-Michel said, breathing heavily. "Tell me where Elise is, exactly."

Henri's face contorted with hatred. "The wine cellar. Behind the last rack. There's a hidden door to a storage room that's already taking on water."

Jean-Michel hauled Henri to his feet, securing his hands behind his back with a decorative cord from the curtains. "You're going to confess everything—the money laundering, the trafficking, and what you did to Elise."

"Or what?" Henri sneered.

"Or I'll ensure the Corsican syndicate learns that you've been skimming from their profits," Jean-Michel bluffed, having noticed discrepancies in the ledger. "I wonder how forgiving they'll be."

The color drained from Henri's face. "You wouldn't."

"Try me."

---

The wine cellar was indeed flooding, water already ankle-deep when Jean-Michel and Camille reached it. They found the hidden door behind the wine rack, just as Henri had described, and forced it open to reveal a small storage room.

Elise lay on a cot, pale and thin but alive, her wrists and ankles bound. The water had already reached the edge of the cot. When she saw Jean-Michel, her eyes filled with tears of relief.

"I knew you'd come," she whispered as he untied her bonds.

"Always," he promised, helping her to her feet. "Can you walk?"

Elise nodded weakly. "I've gathered enough evidence to put Henri away for decades. It's hidden in my shoe."

As they made their way back upstairs, the authorities already en route thanks to Camille's call, Jean-Michel reflected on the journey that had brought them here. The air voyage through the storm had been perilous, but the risk had been necessary. Some duties—to family, to justice—transcended personal safety.

Outside, the storm was beginning to subside, the first rays of dawn breaking through the clouds. Henri had been secured in his study, the ledger and Elise's evidence ensuring he would face justice for his crimes.

Camille stood by the window, watching the sea calm after the tempest. Jean-Michel joined her, taking her hand in his.

"What happens now?" she asked softly.

"We rebuild," he answered. "The vineyard, our lives. Together, if you want."

Camille turned to him, her expression vulnerable in a way he'd never seen at Le Papillon Noir. "My family won't approve. Their religious convictions—"

"Are important to you," Jean-Michel finished. "We'll find a way to honor that part of your life too. But first, we need to honor ourselves and what we've found together."

As Elise joined them, leaning on her brother for support, the three looked out at the brightening horizon—a soldier who had found purpose beyond the battlefield, a nightclub hostess who had discovered her courage, and a journalist whose pursuit of truth had nearly cost her life. Different paths, converging in a moment of triumph over darkness.

In the distance, the small aircraft waited on the airstrip, ready for the journey home.
