# *Time's Gentle Remedy*

The sun beat down mercilessly on the clay courts of the Roland-Garros tournament. Dr. Elena Kovacs wiped sweat from her brow as she adjusted the specialized equipment in her temporary lab space beneath the stands. Her slender fingers, calloused from years of laboratory work, moved with practiced precision over the testing apparatus. As the tournament's consulting chemist, she was responsible for analyzing samples and ensuring no players were using performance-enhancing substances. But her mind wasn't on her work today.

"You're doing that thing again," came a melodic voice from the doorway. "That thing where you pretend to be working but you're actually a million miles away."

Elena looked up to see Margot Beaumont leaning against the doorframe, her wild chestnut curls escaping from beneath a turquoise headscarf, oversized vintage sunglasses perched on her small, freckled nose. The French photographer's bohemian style was as unmistakable as her talent for capturing the raw emotion of the sport.

"Just thinking about Sophia," Elena admitted, referring to her younger sister. "The situation back home is getting worse."

Margot's expression softened as she entered the lab, closing the door behind her. The two women had become unlikely friends since meeting at last year's tournament—the precise chemist and the free-spirited artist finding common ground in their shared Eastern European heritage and love of tennis.

"Any news?" Margot asked, perching on a stool, her bracelets jingling as she set her camera bag down.

Elena shook her head, her dark hair falling across her face. "The National Unity Party is tightening its grip. They've gone from arresting opposition leaders to targeting anyone with connections to the previous government." She swallowed hard. "My father was a science minister under the old administration. Now Sophia's being pressured to publicly denounce him—and me—to keep her university position."

What Elena didn't say was that her sister was being asked to do much more than that. The emails had become increasingly desperate. *They want me to inform on my colleagues, Elena. They're saying it's my patriotic duty. Professor Kovic was taken away yesterday after his son refused to return from Austria.*

"We need to get her out," Margot said simply, reaching across to squeeze Elena's cold hand.

Elena nodded, her gray eyes clouding with worry. "The tournament director promised to help. He has connections with the French embassy."

Outside, thunder rumbled ominously. The weather forecast had been threatening the tournament schedule for days, but so far, the rain had held off. Elena glanced at her watch. She had samples to process before the women's quarterfinals.

"Speaking of the director," Margot said, a strange note in her voice, "I saw him with Christophe Renard earlier."

Elena's hands stilled. Christophe Renard—the tournament's head of security and the man who had been occupying far too many of her thoughts lately. Tall and broad-shouldered, with a military bearing softened by kind eyes the color of aged cognac. Eyes that seemed to see right through her carefully constructed walls.

"They're probably discussing security for the semifinals," Elena said, trying to sound casual as she adjusted her lab coat.

Margot's knowing smile suggested she wasn't fooled. "He asks about you, you know. When I'm photographing the security briefings. His voice changes when he says your name—softer, like he's handling something precious."

Elena felt heat rise to her cheeks. "It's complicated."

"It always is with you, chérie." Margot tilted her head. "You've been here almost a year now. At some point, you have to stop running."

The truth was more complicated than Elena cared to admit. Her growing feelings for Christophe were a luxury she couldn't afford—not with Sophia's situation growing more dire by the day. And there was another complication: Viktor Lazarov.

Viktor—the man who had once been her mentor at the University of Eastern Sciences. The man who had stolen her research on performance-enhancing compounds and published it under his name, destroying her academic reputation and forcing her to flee the country. The man who seemed untouchable, protected by powerful friends in the sports world and the new regime, earning him the nickname "The Immortal" among bitter colleagues.

And now, Viktor was here at Roland-Garros, serving as a consultant to one of the top-seeded Russian players.

"You're thinking about him again," Margot observed, watching Elena's face harden. "The vampire who stole your work."

"He's here to taunt me," Elena said, her voice tight as she gripped the edge of the lab table. "He knows I can't touch him without proof."

"But you have proof now, don't you?" Margot's eyes gleamed behind her sunglasses.

Elena hesitated. She did have proof—emails she'd managed to recover showing Viktor had accessed her research files days before submitting "his" groundbreaking paper. But using it meant risking everything she'd rebuilt. The tournament officials had hired her based on her current reputation, not knowing about the scandal that had forced her to leave her country.

"If I expose him, I could lose this position," Elena said, her voice barely above a whisper. "And without it, I lose the connections I need to help Sophia."

Margot reached across the lab table and squeezed Elena's hand. "Sometimes justice has to wait."

The first fat raindrops began to hit the windows as Elena's phone chimed with a text. It was from Christophe: *Need to speak with you urgently. Meet me at the administration office.*

Elena's stomach tightened. "It's Christophe. He wants to meet."

Margot stood, gathering her camera. "Go. I'll cover for you if anyone asks." She paused at the door. "And Elena? Whatever it is, remember you're not alone anymore."

The administration building was quiet, most staff having relocated to the covered courts where play continued despite the worsening weather. The sound of rain drummed against the roof as Elena made her way down the corridor, her footsteps echoing on the polished floor. She found Christophe in a small conference room, his normally composed face tight with concern.

"Elena," he said, rising when she entered. The fluorescent lights cast shadows under his eyes, suggesting he hadn't slept well. "Thank you for coming quickly."

"What's happened?" she asked, her mind immediately going to Sophia.

"It's about your sister," he confirmed, gesturing for her to sit. "And Viktor Lazarov."

Elena felt the blood drain from her face, leaving her light-headed. "What about them?"

Christophe slid a tablet across the table. On it was an email from the sports ministry of her home country, bearing the new government's stark black and red insignia. "They're demanding we terminate your contract immediately. They claim you're under investigation for research fraud."

"That's absurd," Elena said, though her voice shook. "Viktor stole my work, not the other way around."

"I know," Christophe said quietly.

Elena's head snapped up. "You know?"

"I did some digging after you mentioned his name last month." He leaned forward, his forearms resting on the table. "The timeline didn't add up. Viktor submitted that paper just three days after gaining access to your laboratory during that conference in Geneva. No one produces groundbreaking research that quickly."

Elena stared at him, a mixture of gratitude and confusion washing over her. "You investigated this?"

"I have contacts in international sports security." A muscle in his jaw tightened. "But there's more. They're using your sister as leverage. If you don't resign and return home to face these charges, they're threatening to arrest Sophia for espionage."

The room seemed to tilt. Elena gripped the edge of the table, feeling the cool wood under her fingers. "Espionage? That's—"

"A fabrication, obviously," Christophe finished. "But a convenient one for them. They're claiming she's been passing university research to foreign entities."

Elena closed her eyes briefly, seeing Sophia's face—so like her own, but younger, more idealistic. "This is Viktor's doing. He must have connections with the National Unity Party."

"It appears so," Christophe agreed, his voice hardening. "The tournament director received a call from Viktor this morning, offering to 'smooth things over' if you leave quietly."

"And if I don't?"

"Then they'll arrest Sophia and use her in a show trial about Western corruption of their academic institutions." Christophe's voice was gentle but firm. "You'd be the primary example."

Elena closed her eyes, feeling trapped. If she resigned and returned home, she'd likely be imprisoned on false charges. If she stayed and fought, Sophia would pay the price. Her chest tightened, making it difficult to breathe.

"There has to be another way," she whispered.

Christophe hesitated, then reached across the table. His hand hovered near hers, not quite touching. "There might be. But it would require you to trust me completely."

Elena looked at his outstretched hand, then up at his face—the concern in his eyes, the determined set of his jaw. Slowly, she placed her hand in his. "Tell me."

---

The rain had intensified into a full-blown storm by the time Elena met Margot at the media center. Lightning flashed outside the windows, briefly illuminating the room in stark white light. The photographer was reviewing shots from the morning matches, but set her camera down when she saw Elena's face.

"What's happened?" she asked, leading Elena to a quiet corner where the hum of computers would mask their conversation.

Elena explained the situation in hushed tones, watching Margot's expression shift from shock to determination.

"So Christophe has a plan?" Margot asked, her voice barely audible over the storm.

"A risky one," Elena confirmed, twisting her hands in her lap. "He's been monitoring Viktor's communications since he arrived at the tournament—standard security protocol for all consultants."

"And he found something?"

"Not yet. But he thinks we can trap Viktor into revealing himself." Elena leaned closer. "Christophe believes Viktor is using his position to facilitate doping for certain players. If we can catch him, we expose not just his academic fraud but his current corruption."

"Using you as bait," Margot concluded, her eyes narrowing.

"Yes. But that's not all." Elena glanced around to ensure they weren't overheard. "We need to get Sophia out immediately. Christophe has arranged for an emergency visa, but someone needs to get the documents to her. Someone who won't raise suspicions."

Understanding dawned on Margot's face. "A photographer on assignment."

"You'd need to leave tonight," Elena said. "I know it's asking a lot—"

"I'll do it," Margot interrupted, gripping Elena's arm. "You know I will."

Elena felt tears threaten. "It's dangerous. The National Unity Party has informants everywhere."

"Life is dangerous, chérie. Especially for those who stand by and do nothing." Margot squeezed her hand. "I have press credentials and contacts at the university. I can say I'm doing a feature on women in science. But what about you and Viktor? What's the plan?"

"I'm going to give him exactly what he wants," Elena said grimly. "A public confession."

---

That evening, Elena sat alone in her small apartment near the tournament grounds, listening to the storm gradually subside. Her laptop was open to a secure messaging program Christophe had installed. A notification appeared:

*Margot landed safely. Making contact with S tomorrow morning.*

Elena released a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. Phase one was underway. Now came her part.

She opened her email and began composing a message to Viktor, her fingers trembling slightly on the keyboard:

*Viktor,*

*I understand the tournament has received communications regarding my past. Perhaps it's time we discussed our history directly. I'm prepared to make a statement clarifying the situation.*

*Meet me tomorrow at 9 AM in my lab.*

*Elena*

She hit send before she could reconsider, then closed her eyes, remembering Christophe's words earlier that day:

"Viktor's ego is his weakness," he had said, his voice low and intense as they huddled over coffee in a secluded corner of the tournament café. "He wants public vindication—to see you humiliated. We'll use that."

"And if it doesn't work?" Elena had asked.

Christophe's hand had covered hers, warm and reassuring. "Then I'll personally ensure you and your sister find safety. I promise you that."

The sincerity in his eyes had made her heart flutter in a way that had nothing to do with fear. For the first time in years, Elena allowed herself to imagine a future beyond mere survival.

Her phone chimed with a response from Viktor:

*I always knew you'd eventually see reason. 9 AM it is.*

---

The press conference was hastily arranged for the following morning. The storm had passed, leaving the courts drenched but the sky clear—a brilliant blue that seemed to mock Elena's inner turmoil. Tournament officials announced that Dr. Elena Kovacs would be addressing "concerns about testing protocols" at 10 AM.

Elena stood backstage, her heart hammering against her ribs. She wore her most professional outfit—a charcoal suit that made her look older, more authoritative. Christophe had positioned security personnel strategically throughout the room, each wearing an earpiece connected to his command center.

"Are you ready?" Christophe asked quietly, standing close enough that she could smell his subtle cologne—sandalwood and something uniquely him.

"No," she admitted, adjusting her collar with shaking hands. "But Margot texted an hour ago. She's with Sophia. They're waiting for their flight."

Relief flickered across his face. "Good. Remember, you just need to keep Viktor talking until we receive confirmation they're safely out of the country."

Elena nodded, then impulsively reached for his hand. "Thank you. For believing me."

His fingers tightened around hers. "Always." The word held a promise that made her breath catch.

The meeting with Viktor that morning had gone exactly as planned. He had strutted into her lab, all expensive suit and smug confidence, expecting her capitulation. Instead, she had offered him something better—a public mea culpa that would cement his reputation and destroy hers forever.

"Imagine it, Viktor," she had said, watching his eyes light up with malicious glee. "Me admitting to the world that I tried to steal your work. That I've been lying all these years."

"And why would you do this now?" he had asked, suspicious despite his obvious pleasure.

"Because my sister is more important than my pride," she had answered truthfully. "I want her safe."

That had satisfied him. Viktor had always underestimated the power of love—of loyalty. It was his greatest blind spot.

Now, as the tournament director introduced her, Elena took a deep breath and stepped onto the stage. Cameras flashed as she approached the podium, her professional mask firmly in place. She spotted Viktor in the third row, a smug smile playing at his lips. Beside him sat a man she recognized as a deputy minister from the new regime—here to witness her downfall personally.

"Thank you all for coming," she began, her voice steady despite her racing heart. "I've called this press conference to address some serious allegations regarding my professional conduct."

She paused, making direct eye contact with Viktor.

"For those who don't know, before joining the anti-doping team here at Roland-Garros, I was a research chemist at the University of Eastern Sciences. My work focused on detecting synthetic performance enhancers that mimic natural hormones."

Viktor shifted in his seat, his smile faltering slightly as she deviated from the script they had discussed.

"Five years ago, a groundbreaking paper was published on this very subject—a paper that revolutionized testing protocols in professional sports." Elena took a deep breath. "That paper was published under the name of Professor Viktor Lazarov."

Murmurs rippled through the assembled journalists. Elena could feel sweat beading at her hairline, but she continued, her voice growing stronger.

"Professor Lazarov is here today," Elena continued, gesturing toward him. "Perhaps he'd like to join me and explain how he managed to produce such innovative research just days after gaining access to my private laboratory files?"

The room erupted in questions as Viktor's face darkened. He rose, straightening his expensive suit, a vein pulsing visibly at his temple.

"Dr. Kovacs is clearly suffering from delusions," he said smoothly, though Elena could see the tension in his shoulders. "Her government is investigating her for academic fraud, not me."

"Yes, let's talk about that investigation," Elena replied, her voice steady despite her racing heart. "A convenient investigation launched by officials who receive generous 'consulting fees' from sports organizations you advise."

Viktor's eyes narrowed. "You're making serious accusations without proof."

"Am I?" Elena nodded to Christophe, who activated the large screen behind her.

On it appeared a series of emails—emails between Viktor and government officials, discussing how to "handle the Kovacs problem" and mentioning payments for their cooperation. More damning were the communications with a Russian player's team, offering "special supplements" that would evade current testing protocols.

"Where did you get those?" Viktor demanded, his composure cracking.

"It seems you should be more careful about using the tournament's secure network for your private business," Elena said. "Every consultant's communications are monitored for security purposes—standard protocol that you agreed to when you signed your contract."

She could see the moment Viktor realized he'd been trapped. His face contorted with rage as he lunged toward the stage. "You bitch! You've ruined everything!"

Security personnel moved swiftly, intercepting him before he could reach Elena. The deputy minister was already slipping toward the exit, but Christophe's team had anticipated this, blocking his escape.

Elena's phone vibrated in her pocket—a message from Margot: *Wheels up. We're safe. Love you.*

She closed her eyes briefly, relief washing over her like a physical sensation. When she opened them, Christophe was at her side, a hand at the small of her back as he guided her away from the podium.

"It's over," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "The French authorities are very interested in sports corruption. Viktor won't be bothering you again."

"And my sister?"

"The embassy has confirmed they'll grant her asylum. She'll be here by tomorrow evening."

Elena felt the weight of years lifting from her shoulders. For so long, she had carried her burdens alone—the loss of her research, her reputation, her homeland. The constant fear for her sister. The exhaustion of always looking over her shoulder.

"I don't know how to thank you," she said, looking up at Christophe's face, seeing the warmth in his eyes that had been there from the beginning, if only she'd allowed herself to notice.

"Have dinner with me tonight," he said, his voice soft but certain. "No talk of work or corruption or the past. Just us."

For the first time in years, Elena felt the luxury of possibility unfurling before her. The time for justice had come, and with it, the time for healing—and perhaps something more.

"I'd like that," she said, smiling up at him as they stepped into the sunlight of a new day, her hand finding his as naturally as if they'd been doing this for years.

Behind them, the clay courts of Roland-Garros gleamed in the morning light, washed clean by the night's storm, ready for new matches, new stories, new beginnings.
