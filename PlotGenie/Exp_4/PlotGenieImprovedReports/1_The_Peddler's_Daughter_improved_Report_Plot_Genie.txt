## Summary Report
"The Peddler's Daughter" is an exceptionally well-crafted story that skillfully blends elements of Irish folklore with a deeply human narrative about connection, belonging, and redemption. The character development is particularly strong, with Donal's journey from grief-stricken loner to a man embracing new connections forming the emotional core of the story. The integration of supernatural elements with realistic human struggles creates a compelling narrative tension, while the prose effectively evokes the coastal Irish setting through sensory details and atmospheric description.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Sociological Development**: While the characters are well-developed physically and psychologically, their sociological dimensions (how they fit into and are shaped by their society) could be more fully explored, particularly regarding how Maeve's status as an outcast affects her worldview beyond her relationship with Donal.

* **Pacing in Middle Sections**: Some middle sections could be tightened to maintain narrative momentum, particularly during the investigation phase before Finnegan's confrontation with the Merrow. This would help maintain the tension established in the opening and closing sections.

* **Supernatural Mechanics**: The exact nature and limitations of the Merrow's influence could be more clearly defined to strengthen the logical underpinnings of the supernatural elements. This would help readers understand precisely how and why Finnegan was affected as he was.

* **Revelation Timing**: The revelation about Maeve's parentage, while emotionally satisfying, feels somewhat convenient in its timing. A subtle foreshadowing earlier in the narrative would make this revelation feel more organic and less contrived.
