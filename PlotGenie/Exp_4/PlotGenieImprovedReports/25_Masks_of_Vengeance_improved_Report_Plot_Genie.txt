## Overall Weighted Score: 3.69

## Summary Report:
"Masks of Vengeance" is a well-crafted revenge narrative that successfully transforms into a story about the pursuit of justice over vengeance. The character development is particularly strong, with Marcus's internal struggle and transformation forming the emotional core of the story. The New Orleans Mardi Gras setting provides a thematically appropriate backdrop of masks and hidden identities. The narrative maintains consistent tension through its central conflict while effectively balancing external plot developments with internal character growth.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Resolution pacing**: The resolution comes somewhat abruptly after Dr. Mercer provides the evidence. Expanding this section to show more of the process of vindication would create a more satisfying conclusion and avoid the appearance of a too-convenient resolution.

* **Dr. Mercer's character**: While his introduction is intriguing, his appearance with exactly the right evidence feels somewhat contrived. Providing earlier hints of his existence or showing more of his evidence-gathering process would strengthen the plot's credibility.

* **Consequences exploration**: The aftermath could be developed further to explore the lingering effects of the scandal on Marcus's psychology and relationships, adding depth to his character arc beyond the formal vindication.

* **Elise's character**: As the antagonist, Elise remains somewhat one-dimensional. Providing more insight into her motivations beyond ambition would create a more complex villain and strengthen the thematic exploration of masks and deception.
