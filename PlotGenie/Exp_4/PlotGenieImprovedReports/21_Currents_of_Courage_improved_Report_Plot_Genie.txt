## Overall Weighted Score: 3.60

## Summary Report:
"Currents of Courage" is a well-crafted story that effectively balances external conflict (the flood) with internal character development (Marcus's journey toward emotional vulnerability). The narrative features strong characterization, with Marcus's psychological barriers and growth clearly portrayed alongside a diverse supporting cast. The prose is polished and descriptive, creating vivid imagery of both the physical setting and emotional landscape. While some elements could be further developed, the story successfully integrates its thematic concerns about vulnerability, trust, and moral courage into a compelling narrative arc.

## Suggestions for Improvement:

* **Character Development**: While Victor's change of heart adds complexity to his character, his transformation could be more gradual or foreshadowed earlier to feel more organic and less abrupt.

* **Backstory Integration**: The "incident" with Eliza and the snake that Victor mentions could be more fully integrated into the narrative, perhaps through a brief flashback that would strengthen our understanding of both characters.

* **Resolution Depth**: Consider expanding the resolution to provide more insight into the long-term implications of the flood for the community and Marcus's ranch, which would add depth to the story's conclusion.

* **Sensory Experience**: While the story includes good sensory details, expanding Eliza's perspective through non-visual senses would further enrich the narrative and deepen readers' connection to her experience.
