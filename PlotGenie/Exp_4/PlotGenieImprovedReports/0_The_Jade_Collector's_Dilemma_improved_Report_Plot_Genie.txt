## Summary Report
"The Jade Collector's Dilemma" is an exceptionally well-crafted story with strong character development, compelling conflict, and professional-level writing. The protagonist's ethical journey is convincingly portrayed through his interactions with well-defined supporting characters. The central conflict effectively operates on multiple levelsâ€”personal, interpersonal, and culturalâ€”creating a rich narrative experience.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
* **Character physicality**: While Wei and other characters have some physical descriptions, adding more distinctive physical traits and mannerisms would make them even more vivid and memorable.
* **Victor's revelation**: The revelation about Victor's Interpol background could benefit from subtle foreshadowing earlier in the story to make this twist feel more integrated.
* **Henry's motivations**: Develop Henry's psychological obsession with the seals more gradually to make his extreme behavior in the climax more believable.
* **Sensory details**: Incorporate more sensory details beyond the visualâ€”sounds, smells, textures of Chinatown and other settingsâ€”to create a more immersive reading experience.
* **Technical details**: Provide more specific explanation for how Henry accessed Wei's email accounts to make this plot point more credible.
