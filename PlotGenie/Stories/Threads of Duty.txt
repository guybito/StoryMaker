# *Threads of Duty*

The summer heat in Dixie was unforgiving, pressing down on Elijah Harmon's shoulders as he surveyed the cotton fields stretching before him. At thirty-five, Elijah had spent nearly half his life as foreman of Willow Creek Plantation, his dark skin weathered by years under the Southern sun. The Civil War had ended decades ago, but in 1890s Georgia, freedom remained a complicated concept, especially for a Black man in his position.

Elijah adjusted his worn hat, watching the workers move through the fields. His position was precarious—respected by the white landowners for his efficiency, resented by some for his authority, and viewed with mixed feelings by the Black workers he supervised. The burden of straddling these worlds had carved deep lines around his eyes and mouth, aging him beyond his years.

"Mr. Harmon," a soft voice called from behind him. "I've finished the sample patterns you asked for."

Turning, Elijah's stern expression softened at the sight of Sarah Calloway. At twenty-eight, Sarah was the plantation's master weaver, her slender fingers capable of transforming raw cotton into the finest fabrics that fetched premium prices in Atlanta and beyond. Her light brown hair was pulled back in a practical bun, though a few strands had escaped in the humidity, framing a face that held both gentleness and determination.

"Thank you, Miss Calloway," he replied formally, though they had known each other for years. As the daughter of the previous plantation owner and now the cousin-by-marriage to the current one, Sarah occupied an unusual position. Her father's death had left her nearly destitute, forcing her to use her weaving skills for survival rather than mere accomplishment.

What few knew was that Sarah and Elijah had formed an unlikely alliance. Together, they had developed a plan to establish a cooperative mill where freed slaves and poor whites could work together, sharing profits more equitably than the exploitative sharecropping system that had replaced slavery. Their vision was revolutionary for the time and place—perhaps dangerously so.

"The merchants in Savannah are very interested," Sarah said quietly, handing him the fabric samples. "If we can secure the funding by harvest, we could break ground on the mill before winter."

Elijah nodded, carefully tucking the samples into his jacket. Their fingers brushed momentarily, a touch that lingered a second too long. The unspoken feelings between them were yet another complication in an already complex situation—a Black foreman and a white woman in the post-Reconstruction South could not openly acknowledge such sentiments.

"We'll need to be careful," Elijah warned. "Reverend Thornton has been stirring up trouble again."

The mention of the firebrand preacher made Sarah's expression tighten. Reverend Josiah Thornton had arrived in the county a year earlier, establishing a church that preached a toxic blend of religious fervor and racial hatred. His sermons increasingly targeted any cooperation between races as "ungodly mixing" and called for a return to stricter segregation.

"He's organizing a revival meeting next Sunday," Sarah confirmed. "My cousin's wife is quite taken with his preaching."

What made Thornton particularly dangerous was his ability to frame his bigotry as patriotic duty. With the Spanish-American War brewing, he had begun equating racial purity with American strength, claiming that "race-mixing" would weaken the nation in its time of need. Many young men, eager to prove their patriotism, had fallen under his sway.

Among them was Sarah's nephew, James Calloway, the sixteen-year-old son of her late brother. James had once been close to both Sarah and Elijah, the latter having taught the boy how to fish and hunt. But adolescence and Thornton's influence had transformed him into a hostile stranger who now openly opposed his aunt's friendship with Elijah.

"James came to the weaving shed yesterday," Sarah said, lowering her voice. "He said I was betraying my father's memory by working with you. He threatened to tell Reverend Thornton about our plans for the mill."

Elijah's jaw tightened. "Did he mention the account books?"

Sarah nodded grimly. The account books were their greatest vulnerability. To fund their mill project, they had been skimming small amounts from the plantation's profits—not enough to be immediately noticed, but sufficient to raise serious questions if discovered. Elijah, who managed the plantation's finances, had falsified records to cover their tracks. Discovery would mean not just the end of their dream but likely imprisonment for Elijah and disgrace for Sarah.

"We need to move faster," Elijah decided. "The war fever is making Thornton bolder. If we wait until harvest, it may be too late."

Their conversation was interrupted by the approach of riders. Elijah and Sarah quickly stepped apart as three men on horseback approached—Reverend Thornton himself, flanked by two of his most devoted followers. The preacher was a tall, imposing figure with a neatly trimmed beard and eyes that burned with zealous conviction.

"Miss Calloway," Thornton greeted Sarah with exaggerated courtesy, ignoring Elijah completely. "I've come to speak with your cousin about a matter of community importance."

"Mr. Bedford is in town today," Sarah replied coolly.

"Then perhaps you might relay our message," Thornton continued. "We're organizing a boycott of any businesses that employ coloreds in positions above their station." His eyes flicked dismissively toward Elijah. "Including plantations with... inappropriate management arrangements."

The threat was unmistakable. Without waiting for a response, Thornton tipped his hat to Sarah and rode toward the main house, his companions following.

"A boycott would ruin Bedford," Elijah said quietly once they were alone again. "He's leveraged to the hilt with the bank. If he can't sell this year's crop..."

"He'd have to sell the plantation," Sarah finished. "And any new owner would certainly replace you."

The stakes had just risen dramatically. Their mill project wasn't just about creating opportunity anymore—it was about survival.

Over the following weeks, tension in the county escalated. Thornton's boycott gained traction, with several merchants refusing to handle cotton from Willow Creek. Meanwhile, James had begun following Sarah and reporting her movements to Thornton. The boy's hostility had taken on a frightening edge, his adolescent confusion channeled into righteous anger.

Elijah faced mounting pressure as well. Several workers, fearing association with him would mark them as targets, began to distance themselves. Others, who had secretly supported the mill project, now wavered in their commitment.

The situation reached a breaking point when Elijah discovered something unexpected while reviewing old property records for their mill site. Buried in the yellowed pages was evidence that Reverend Thornton's father—a man the preacher claimed had been a Confederate hero—had actually been a Northern carpetbagger who had exploited freed slaves after the war. More shocking still, there were indications that Thornton himself was the son of a Black woman, his paternity concealed to protect his father's reputation.

"This would destroy him," Sarah whispered when Elijah showed her the documents. "His entire identity is built on racial purity."

"We could use this," Elijah suggested, the desperation of their situation pushing him toward a moral compromise he would once have rejected.

Sarah looked troubled. "Blackmail, Elijah? Is that who we are now?"

Before they could resolve this ethical dilemma, disaster struck. James, who had been eavesdropping, stole the documents and brought them to Thornton. The preacher, enraged by this threat to his carefully constructed identity, gathered a group of followers and rode for Willow Creek, intent on silencing Elijah permanently.

Word reached the plantation just before dusk. One of the field hands, loyal to Elijah, ran to warn him that armed men were approaching. "They're saying you're stirring up trouble, Mr. Harmon. Reverend's telling folks you're planning an uprising."

Elijah knew immediately what had happened. "Where's Miss Calloway?"

"At the main house, I think. Mr. Bedford's returned from town."

Elijah raced toward the plantation house, hoping to warn Sarah and possibly seek protection from Bedford, who, whatever his faults, was a pragmatic businessman who valued Elijah's management skills. But as he approached, he saw Thornton's group already arriving, with James riding proudly alongside the preacher.

Hiding in the shadows of the garden, Elijah watched in horror as Thornton confronted Bedford on the front porch, brandishing the documents about his father.

"This nigger foreman of yours has been spreading lies about my family," Thornton raged. "He's turned the Calloway woman against her own kind and is planning some kind of mixed-race business that'll bring ruin to decent white folks."

Bedford, a thin man with calculating eyes, seemed unmoved. "Reverend, I run a business, not a church. Harmon makes me money."

"Not anymore," Thornton countered. "Not with our boycott. And there's more at stake than money. This is about our way of life, about the purity of our race when our nation needs strength."

The standoff might have continued, but James suddenly pointed toward the garden. "There he is! I see Harmon hiding there!"

Several men turned, raising their rifles. Elijah knew he should run, but his feet seemed rooted to the spot. In that moment, he saw his entire life—the careful compromises, the deferred dreams, the unspoken love—flash before him. He had always known it might end this way, a Black man who had reached too high, struck down for his ambition.

Then, incredibly, salvation came from the most unexpected source. A carriage came barreling up the drive, nearly colliding with the gathered horses. The door flew open, and out stepped an elderly Black man in a well-worn but dignified suit, leaning heavily on a cane.

"What in God's name is happening here?" the man demanded, his voice carrying the unmistakable authority of advanced age and absolute certainty.

The interruption created just enough confusion for Elijah to slip away from his exposed position and circle around to the back of the house. From there, he could hear the conversation continuing.

"This doesn't concern you, old man," Thornton said dismissively.

"I believe it does, Josiah," the elderly man replied, using the preacher's first name with familiar ease. "Especially when you're about to lynch a man over the very secret I've come to reveal."

A hush fell over the gathering. Even from his hiding place, Elijah could feel the shift in atmosphere.

"Who are you?" Bedford demanded.

"My name is Isaiah Johnson," the old man announced. "And I've come from Alabama to find my son, Josiah, born to me and a white woman named Elizabeth Thornton some fifty years ago."

The revelation hit like a thunderclap. Thornton's face drained of color as the old man continued, his voice gaining strength.

"I was her father's house slave. We loved each other, but when she got with child, they sent her away. When she returned, she claimed the baby had died. It was only on her deathbed last month that she told me the truth—that our son had been raised as white, taking her family name."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Thornton's followers looked to him in confusion, while James appeared stricken, his worldview crumbling before his eyes.

Seizing the moment of distraction, Elijah emerged from his hiding place and stepped forward, positioning himself between the armed men and the house where Sarah now stood in the doorway.

"Gentlemen," Elijah said, his voice steady despite his racing heart, "it seems we all have some reflecting to do on who we truly are and what truly matters in this life."

The standoff lasted several tense moments before Thornton, his authority shattered, turned and rode away alone. His followers, uncertain what to believe, gradually dispersed, leaving Bedford, Sarah, Elijah, James, and the elderly Isaiah Johnson on the porch.

In the weeks that followed, the county experienced a quiet transformation. Thornton left town, unable to face the community after his heritage was revealed. The boycott collapsed without his leadership. Isaiah Johnson, having found his long-lost son only to lose him again to pride, accepted Sarah and Elijah's invitation to stay at Willow Creek.

Most surprisingly, James, his certainties shaken to the core, began a painful process of questioning everything he had been taught. His relationship with his aunt and Elijah remained strained, but the hostility had been replaced by a wary curiosity.

As for Sarah and Elijah, they proceeded with their mill project, now with Bedford's reluctant blessing—he had recognized which way the winds were blowing and decided to position himself accordingly. Their personal relationship remained necessarily discreet, but in the privacy of the weaving shed, their hands now met without hesitation.

"Do you think it can work?" Sarah asked one evening as they reviewed the architectural plans for the mill. "Not just the business, but everything else—people working together, living together, seeing each other as equals?"

Elijah looked out the window at the twilight settling over the fields where generations had toiled under oppression. "It won't be easy," he admitted. "There will always be those who preach division. But today, we choose a different path."

Outside, Isaiah Johnson sat on the porch with young James, teaching the boy to whittle—one small thread in a new fabric they were all learning to weave together.
